Subject: RE: Distribution Form Phillip, The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral. You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution. I checked with my director (Pam Butler) on your question about recouping taxes already paid. It is my understanding that you cannot recoup these taxes. Thanks, Renee -----Original Message----- From: Allen, Phillip K.

It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income. What about Social Security and Medicare taxes? I thought those were already deducted. Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made. On the contrary, there are losses. Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid? Thanks for you help.
