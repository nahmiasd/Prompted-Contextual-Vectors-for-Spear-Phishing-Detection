{"email_subject": "Re: Talking points about California Gas market", "email_body": "Phillip--To the extent that we can give Chair Hoecker our spin on the reasons for the hikes, we would like to. The Commission is getting calls from legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some response. Better if it coincides with Enron's view and is not anti-market. We still haven't decided what we will provide. You definitely will be included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting. Thanks.

I don't understand why we need to give our commentary on why prices are so high in California. This subject has already gotten so much press.

Let me or Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever. I am supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after that, get it to Christi.
