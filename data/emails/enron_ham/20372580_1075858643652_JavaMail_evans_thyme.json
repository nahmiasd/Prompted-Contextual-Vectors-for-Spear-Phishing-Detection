{"email_subject": "RE: Final Internal Review for Sign Off: Topics and Related\n Objectives", "email_body": "Kirk, I would modify this document slightly. The first section is titled \"Introduction to Risk Management\" and the second section is \"Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products\". However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section. I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged. Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools. Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section. The third section would include the roles and accounting basics. You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.
