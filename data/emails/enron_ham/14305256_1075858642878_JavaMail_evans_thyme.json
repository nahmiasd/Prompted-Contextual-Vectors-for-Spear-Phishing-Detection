{"email_subject": "RE:", "email_body": "According to Jacques, the release is with the Kuo's attorney, Kevin Kolb. I just spoke to Kevin. The Kuo's have been away on vacation. He is going to try and get things finalized this week. It sounds like they want to sign and exchange money in person. This Saturday afternoon in Seguin will probably be the most convenient time. I will let you know when I hear more from Kevin Kolb.
