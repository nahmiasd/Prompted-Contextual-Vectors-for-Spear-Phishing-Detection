Ina Rangel 01/30/2001 12:31 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Access training - please respond John, The guy from Nymex can not come until next week, Thursday 2/8/01 at 4:00. It will last at a minimum of three hours and a maximum of 4 hours (which is unlikely). There is nothing on your calendar for that day. Will this day and time work for you? Let me know and then I will send an email out to the desk to make arrangements to attend the meeting that day. -Ina", "id": "24512879_1075857657431_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
