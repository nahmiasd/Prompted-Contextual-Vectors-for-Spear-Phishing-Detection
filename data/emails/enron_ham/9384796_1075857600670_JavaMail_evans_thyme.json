Seems like they have not been successful with plan A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll keep chasing it.

I told him that you would call because of your experience with setting up funds. They have two main problems. One is setting up their internal systems. Second, they have credit problems with a BBB+. Please call and introduce yourself. Thanks, john To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: FW: trading John, did you answer him or should I respond?
