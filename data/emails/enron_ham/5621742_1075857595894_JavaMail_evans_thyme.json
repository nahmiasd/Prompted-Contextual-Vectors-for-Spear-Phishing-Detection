The first Sunday that we opened for trading (I believe it was 10/1), we experienced a shutdown of the entire site late Saturday which, unfortunately included our monitors, which is why we were not aware of it until just prior to trading time. Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by aprox 2:15pm. I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15. This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on Saturday. We are working on our release procedures and will make every effort to have smoother releases in the future. I hope this answers your questions, if not feel free to give me a call. 3-0305 bbh Andy Zipper 10/24/2000 09:04 AM To: Bob Hillier/NA/Enron@Enron, David Forster/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jay Webb/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: sunday Can we get to the bottom of this asap. ---------------------- Forwarded by Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron on 10/24/2000 09:02 AM --------------------------- John Arnold@ECT 10/22/2000 06:23 PM To: Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Andy: I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed the opening until 6:05. This is the third time in four or five sessions when EOL had problems on Sunday. Anything you can do to improve reliability would be appreciated.
