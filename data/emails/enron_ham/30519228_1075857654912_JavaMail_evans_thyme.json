However, the game right now is not sell and hold...although it will be soon. The game is where will it be tomorrow and next week and next month. The market is structurally short term gas thanks to our friends from california. where ca is buying power, williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500 or 525. irrelevant. so term is not going down in the short term unless the front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.
