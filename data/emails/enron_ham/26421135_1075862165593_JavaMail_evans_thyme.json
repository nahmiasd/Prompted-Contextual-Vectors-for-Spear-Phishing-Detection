Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Frolov, Yevgeny Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 10:26 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Cc: McDaniel, Kirk; Coleman, Brad; O'rourke, Tim Subject: BRM Case & Options Importance: High Phillip, I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday. Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and 2nd cash flow impact. In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost. (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K) The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one. Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. Also, I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions. I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time. We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses. One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow. Is BRM \"core\" to the Enron for next few months or new organization? Please consider the costs of finishing this project.
