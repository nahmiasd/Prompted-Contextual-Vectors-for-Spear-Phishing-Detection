I do appreciate your offer but I don't want to take away from the amazing year you've had so far. Maybe you should come trade this... John Jim Schwieger 12/06/2000 05:42 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: For What It's Worth. Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could have done. I believe you are one of those individuals. I appreciate what you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on. This especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 months. You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX liquidity to cover your risk. I would like to offer to transfer $30 million out of the Storage Book to the Price Book. Without you and EOL I could never have done what I've done. Thanks, Jim Schwieger", "id": "173369_1075857571292_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
