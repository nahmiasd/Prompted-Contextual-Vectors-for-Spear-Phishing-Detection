I am going to try and meet Pauline Kuo on Tuesday or Wednesday to wrap things up. In addition to the release, I will need the guarantee and a release of lien for the smaller note.

The changes are alright. I will make the revisions and call you. I am at MD Anderson tomorrow morning, so it will probably be late tomorrow or over the weekend. We will coordinate Monday morning so I can get you everything you need for the closing. Thanks. Jacques", "id": "13406933_1075858643056_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
