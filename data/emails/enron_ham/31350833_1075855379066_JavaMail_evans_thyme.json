{"email_subject": "Re:", "email_body": "Frank, The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position. Whatever the risk was prior should not matter. Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset. If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted. Phillip", "id": "31350833_1075855379066_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
