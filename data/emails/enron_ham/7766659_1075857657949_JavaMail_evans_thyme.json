We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 Wharton School students visiting Enron. A Wharton tiger team works through a semester on a special project, proposed by a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the impact of electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will result in a report that will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that you will find this report useful. We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on Thursday, January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron. I would appreciate if you could find 30 minutes on Friday to talk to the students. The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.
