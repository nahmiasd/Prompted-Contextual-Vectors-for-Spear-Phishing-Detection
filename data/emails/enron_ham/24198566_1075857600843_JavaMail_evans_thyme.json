If you do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release. If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august. any questions please feel free to call. -andy", "id": "24198566_1075857600843_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
