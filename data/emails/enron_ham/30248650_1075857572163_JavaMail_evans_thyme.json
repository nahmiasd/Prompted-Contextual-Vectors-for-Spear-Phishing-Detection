{"email_subject": "OTC NG Price Book Trades", "email_body": "The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate unique deal. An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 8th, 2000. It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and Q86409.4. These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore count as a total of four deals. We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as just one large deal with 4 different parts. Unfortunately, the EOL Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal. Since this currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals. This results in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals. If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.
