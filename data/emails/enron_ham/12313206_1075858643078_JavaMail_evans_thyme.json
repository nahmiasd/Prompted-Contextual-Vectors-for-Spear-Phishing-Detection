It makes me miss Portland. -----Original Message----- From: Belden, Tim Sent: Friday, September 07, 2001 12:40 PM To: Allen, Phillip K. Subject: Bike Commute Check out this web site. We are competing with all companies in Portland for who can ride the most to work for the month of September. We are going to win. We have about 130 people in the office which produces about 5,000 trips (each way counts as one). This week, we cycled 200+ trips. The winner last year won with 12%. We're going to get 15+%. Then we'll shut up those left leaning, Enron bashing Portland people.", "id": "12313206_1075858643078_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
