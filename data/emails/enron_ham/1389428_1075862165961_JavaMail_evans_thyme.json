Seeing as you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our media production tasks. As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and enjoyable to work with. Below is an email from Steve, the director for our storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process. Have a good day! Sheri A.

I can't believe it's over already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and 7th of December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for those dates. I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit suite availability we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call tomorrow but if anything comes up just give me a buzz! Thanks Sheri!

There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been discussing. These changes result in: Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below) No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and talent) that we have casted for. Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts. We have recieved today (mid-day). Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th. This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our scripts. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a wonderful Thanksgiving! Sheri A.
