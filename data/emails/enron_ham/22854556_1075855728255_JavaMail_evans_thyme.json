Remember their rotations last for one year. Do you want to be an interviewer?

While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting event. We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed. I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above). We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon. We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session. Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date. In addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. Thank you, Jana", "id": "22854556_1075855728255_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
