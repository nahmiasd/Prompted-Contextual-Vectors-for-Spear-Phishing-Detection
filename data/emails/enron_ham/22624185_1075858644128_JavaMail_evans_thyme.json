We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed. We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery. There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials. Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2\" wide door opening. I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900. Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive. It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske. This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it. Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though. The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door. We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door. The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500. We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs. With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time. If you have any questions just e-mail me or call: Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364 My Home number 715-985-3063. Have a good one and take with you later.
