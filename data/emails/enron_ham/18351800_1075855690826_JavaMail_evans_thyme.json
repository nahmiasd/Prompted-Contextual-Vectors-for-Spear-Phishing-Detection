{"email_subject": "Re: balance on truck/loan", "email_body": "Mary, If we add both balances together the total is $1,140. I can spread it over 6 or 12 months. 6 month payout would be $190/month. 12 month payout would be $95/month. Your choice. I would like it if you could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so. Does $10/hr sound fair? We can apply it to the loan. Phillip", "id": "18351800_1075855690826_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
