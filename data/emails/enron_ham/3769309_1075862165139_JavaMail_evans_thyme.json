{"email_subject": "RE: Muni Bond Ladder", "email_body": "I would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin. The call's I am short are way out of the money. The only positions that are changing very much in value are the Enron shares I am long and the Enron puts I am short. I would consider closing those positions. I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's. Please forward this email to Steve.

Subject: Muni Bond Ladder Phillip: Steve and I are inquiring on the email you sent him. We wanted come up with a Muni proposal for 1M and take it from there. At this point, we have about 1.3M available but using this full amount would not give us any cushion in regards to margin. Let us know if the 1M is OK with you; assuming we can always go in and invest more into the bond ladder.
