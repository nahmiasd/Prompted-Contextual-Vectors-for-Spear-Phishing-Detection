{"email_subject": "Re: NG YEAR ENd Quiz", "email_body": "fill me in. how can i eavesdrop?? To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: NG YEAR ENd Quiz I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in. Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.
