{"email_subject": "Re:", "email_body": "We've started breaking out separate P&L's. It's been a very difficult process so far for a number of reasons. The last processes will be separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen this week. Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero or an adjustment will be made to get it there. At the end of the year there will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute. His contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will continue to be a subjective process.
