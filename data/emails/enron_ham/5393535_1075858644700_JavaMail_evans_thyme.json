{"email_subject": "RE:", "email_body": "Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft. excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM To: Morgan, Richard Subject: Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help.
