From: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 10/10/2000 10:28 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Substantiation for EOL Hi, I was hoping that you could give me a few minutes after trading hours to help me substantiate the EOL commercial. ABC is threatening not to run it if I don't prove that \"Enron has created the First Internet Global Commodities Market.\" I can easily prove we are the largest, but I'm having a hard time with first. I know we were, but I have to have it in writing. Give me a call or email me and let me know when you have a second or two. Thanks, Margaret", "id": "18518186_1075857596951_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
