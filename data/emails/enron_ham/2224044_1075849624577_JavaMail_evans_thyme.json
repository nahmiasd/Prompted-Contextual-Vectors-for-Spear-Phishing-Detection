Colleen was more than helpful and provided services that I found invaluable. She was extremely well liked by the senior management of Vengas and spent a great deal of time with them in creating an environment conducive to teamwork and productivity. Her language skills, knowledge and personality provided an incredible resource. Thanks for allowing my program her services and I look forward to working with her again in the future.
