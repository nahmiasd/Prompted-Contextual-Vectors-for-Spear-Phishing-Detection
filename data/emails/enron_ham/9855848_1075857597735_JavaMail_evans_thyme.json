{"email_subject": "Re: Commercials", "email_body": "I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e. weather, EOL, bandwidth). The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level than where my brain operates. Still not quite sure what was going on there. Ode was a bit too idealistic. The campaign in general was very different than previous. But I guess you know that and that's the point. Again, I think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive. Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact. Sorry I ruined your run. At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car thief. From: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 09/27/2000 08:24 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Commercials So, what did you think?! Don't lie or stretch the truth either -- you won't hurt my feelings, I promise. By the way, by the time I arrived home it was completely dark so I went for a three mile run this morning. Not fun, but I'm definitely awake right now! BUT, it's all your fault I couldn't go last night....he!he! Trade well, MSA", "id": "9855848_1075857597735_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
