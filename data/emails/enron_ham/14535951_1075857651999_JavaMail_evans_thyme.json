I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end. In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done. However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable. Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago. I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat. I will keep you posted - John Arnold 04/08/2001 08:15 PM To: Kim Ward/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: hey: just wondering if you're still up for sailing lessons and if you've found out anything???", "id": "14535951_1075857651999_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
