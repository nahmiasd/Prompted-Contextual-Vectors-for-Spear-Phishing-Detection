{"email_subject": "Re: Denver trading", "email_body": "In regards to your E-mail, I have recently been informed by Nicole that she will be leaving Enron effective April 30. This is unfortunate because she has been a very valuable member of our team over the last few years and has been instrumental in developing the Eastern Rockies trading business and providing our customers with excellent service. Nicole is not leaving to go to a competitor, but is going to spend more time with her family. Given this fact, you probably want to speed up the transition. Call me and we can discuss.

The plan is for Susan to work with me in moving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston. Her specific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and Theresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence. Susan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara. She is also working on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different trading points from Opal to the mid-continent. My plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April 22 - April 24). I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time. I will probably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with us and the logistics team, maybe in early May. Then, Susan and I will both go to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to complete the transfer of operations to the Houston office. We can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding reservations. Thank you, Jay", "id": "27798412_1075855696053_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
