Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery. One of the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in bulk as a heating fuel. They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering it. Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels? Regards", "id": "29956099_1075857571069_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
