What is your official email path? I am assuming that you are using Outlook. I am here at work trying to close a deal. I will forward your message to Grass, but I want to visually see the layout of the floor. I will end up having spots on five and six. Also, Nelson Ferries' and Linda Roberts' location are very important to the Wellhead/Ecommerce effort. And yes, John will need room to grow. What did you think of the article? Mrha -----Original Message----- From: Arnold, John Sent: Monday, April 30, 2001 8:23 PM To: Mrha, Jean Subject: Jean: I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you. The area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, long-term originators, and mid-market orig group. not exactly who you need to be around. the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups. most importantly, it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand. call me if you want to talk further.... thanks for the article. john", "id": "15158297_1075857650899_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
