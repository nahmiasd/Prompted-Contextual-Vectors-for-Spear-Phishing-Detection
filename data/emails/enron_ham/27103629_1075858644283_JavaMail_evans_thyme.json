{"email_subject": "RE: Distribution Form", "email_body": "Renee, Thank you for the forms. I am trying to estimate my tax obligation. It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income. What about Social Security and Medicare taxes? I thought those were already deducted. Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made. On the contrary, there are losses. Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid? Thanks for you help.
