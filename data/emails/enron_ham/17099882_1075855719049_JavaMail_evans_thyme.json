If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where did they come from? I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet. As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today. It's much better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track. Thanks.
