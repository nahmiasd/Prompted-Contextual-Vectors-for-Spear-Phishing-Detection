Huntley, CFP\" <wise.counsel@lpl.com>@ENRON Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 1:50 PM To: Allen, Phillip K. Subject: Huntley/question Phillip, Could you please do me a favor? I would like to read your current title policy to see what it says about easements. You should have received a copy during your closing. I don't know how many pages it will be but let me know how you want to handle getting a copy made. I'll be happy to make the copy, or whatever makes it easy for you. Thanks, Bob Huntley", "id": "21595278_1075858644261_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
