{"email_subject": "How are things in Houston?", "email_body": "Hello Mr. Arnold, I hope that things have calmed down in the gas market with the cold weather finally developing. I have been selected to come to Houston for final round interviews. Do you know if visitors can come to the trading floor to see what the operations are like? Also, if you have any hints on approaching the final round of interviews, I would appreciate them. Thank you for your help during the application process, and I hope you have a good week. Cordially, Adam Bayer", "id": "2795581_1075857572206_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
