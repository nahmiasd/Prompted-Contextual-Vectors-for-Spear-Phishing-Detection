{"email_subject": "Re:", "email_body": "most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short. next sellers need to be from producer community. saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community. short covering rallies will get more common here. velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week). my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them? might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5.", "id": "26284087_1075857649441_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
