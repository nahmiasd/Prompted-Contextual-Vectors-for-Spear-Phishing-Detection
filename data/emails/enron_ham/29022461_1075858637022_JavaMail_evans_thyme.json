{"email_subject": "RE: howdy!!", "email_body": "Philip, What is going on down the street? Curious to hear any perspectives you may wish to offer from the trading floor? Enron stock is now lower than when I joined the company out of business school. I imagine there are quite a few not so happy people these days. We can relate somewhat over here at NPW with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago). Knowing you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down much. I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW. Hope everything else is going well for you and the family. Have you had the knee surgery yet? Give me a call when you have a chance.
