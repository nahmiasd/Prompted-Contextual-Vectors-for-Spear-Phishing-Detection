{"email_subject": "RE: technical help for interviewing traders", "email_body": "In regards to gas: what signals do you for in determining your view? no right answer. some examples are strength or weakness in financial basis and index markets, customer flow, cash/futures spread, technical analysis, storage projections, price action, etc. what resources do you use to formulate a price view? goal is to see how much he analyzes the fundamentals of the market weather - does candidate look at weather models such as american, european, and canadian operational runs or does he just subscribe to a weather service storage - has he built an aga forecasting model or does he just wait for others to tell him projections production - has candidate dug into eia production data, company specific drilling results, or state specific (such as texas railroad commission reports) end of season storage number - has candidate built a longer term forecast of where we end up in storage. give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer. where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest level we've been at in past 5 years? what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market? what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? What do you expect in the next 5? how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given day? In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty What are delta/gamma/theta? if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero? Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts? If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal? what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if corresponding futures are trading $5? what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to be effective in interviewing Gas Traders. Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order to help her screen some candidates. It would be great if you could respond to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select good Gas Traders. Thanks for your help.
