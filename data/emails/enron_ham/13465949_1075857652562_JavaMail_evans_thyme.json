No. Did Dan Reeves settle with John Elway? No. Did Anna Nicole Smith settle with her in-laws? No. But Salomon Smith Barney and Enron have settled all the issues and have agreed to the $50 million credit facility. The documents are in Mary Cook's capable hands and should be completed next week. In addition, I hope that Jon Davis' cooling demand presentation on Wednesday (3:15) will be valuable for your trading endeavors. John Galperin (on our desk) will introduce Jon. Try to stay awake during John's introduction.", "id": "13465949_1075857652562_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
