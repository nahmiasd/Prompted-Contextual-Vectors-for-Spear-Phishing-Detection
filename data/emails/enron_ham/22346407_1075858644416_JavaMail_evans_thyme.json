Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 7:58 AM To: '\"Simpkins, Michelle\" <MSimpkins@winstead.com Subject: RE: Blackline of First Amendment to Contract Michelle, Here are my comments: Section 9b- It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002. Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans. I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the \"Utility Lines\". Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C. Section 10- Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable. Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other. I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.
