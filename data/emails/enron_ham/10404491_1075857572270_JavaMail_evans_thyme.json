{"email_subject": "RE: Resume", "email_body": "John, Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most expeditious way. I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that looked like a good fit. It was an asset evaluation and integration job for Enron North America: job # 0000105886. My primary strengths are: Natural gas asset acquisition and management Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and derivatives execution Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a competitive reason to be in the market, i.e. transportation spreads, storage, physical presence Good customer relations/account development Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities Stong negotiator I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities. Where I am coming from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every trend imaginable in leveraging itself. I appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks.

I'll make sure it goes through the proper channels. It may help if you give specific positions that interest you most as Enron is such a big place, it will help focus the resume to the right people.
