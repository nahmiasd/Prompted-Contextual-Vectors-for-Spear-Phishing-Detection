{"email_subject": "Re: Sunday Trading", "email_body": "Savita: A couple of issues: 1. I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis child (grandchild). Is this not currently allowed by the system? 2. I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they meant to trade nymex. Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly. Eventually I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm restricted right now by issue #1. Please advise, John", "id": "10159852_1075857596543_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
