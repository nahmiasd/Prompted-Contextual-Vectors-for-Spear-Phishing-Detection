I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.
