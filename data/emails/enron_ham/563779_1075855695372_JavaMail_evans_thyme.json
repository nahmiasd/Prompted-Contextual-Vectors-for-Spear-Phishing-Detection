{"email_subject": "Re: Answers to List", "email_body": "Thanks for the response. I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step. I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft. He took my plan and improved it. I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans. While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list. Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners. I will be in San Marcos on Friday April 13th. Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through that day? Also can you provide some references? Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust your bid.
