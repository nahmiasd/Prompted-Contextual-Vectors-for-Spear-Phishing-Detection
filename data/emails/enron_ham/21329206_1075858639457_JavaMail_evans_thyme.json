{"email_subject": "RE: The Stage", "email_body": "Jeff, The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20. You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000. It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20. Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes. But I have not received payment on either. Let's try and wrap this up this week.

Subject: The Stage The kuo's are having their attorney look at the agreement. They need to transfer their onwership into a LLP with your consent before they can sign the agreement. Pauline is contacting the bank for their consent also. You may need to sign a consent form to transfer the LLP. I will keep you posted.
