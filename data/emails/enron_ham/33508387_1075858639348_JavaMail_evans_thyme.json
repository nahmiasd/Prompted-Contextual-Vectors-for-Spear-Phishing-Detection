Can you please add Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Frank Ermis, and myself to your email distribution list. We are all holding significant gas positions in California and are greatly affected by any gas or power developments withing the state. With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information? This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums. Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.

SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer. SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians. Sue Mara Enron Corp.
