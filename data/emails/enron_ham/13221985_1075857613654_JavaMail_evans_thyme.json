However, by staying in Dallas, did experience a white New Year's eve.? Never made it to Addison Cafe for New Year's eve dinner (back up plans), roads were just too bad.? But I cooked fresh salmon at home and we had a very lovely dinner. Hope you had a wonderful celebration (not quite the same as last year in Sidney, now was it) and brought in the new year with a bang! Have a happy, healthy and much more prosperous 2001!? I wish only the best for you.? Love you much, your Mom", "id": "13221985_1075857613654_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
