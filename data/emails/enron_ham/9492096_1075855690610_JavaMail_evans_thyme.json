The WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" generation. You are pulling \"scheduled.\" If someone doesn't schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the \"scheduled\" number. The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished. I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption. I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses. If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.
