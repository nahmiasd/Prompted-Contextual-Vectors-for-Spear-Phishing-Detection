{"email_subject": "Re: What's happening?", "email_body": "Al, I was glad to hear from you. I hope we can put the past behind us. Sounds like you have been busy. Congratulations on the new baby. Judging from your email all is well with you. That's great. We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace). Three is it for us. What's your target? The other two are doing well. Soccer, T-ball, and bike riding keeps them busy. They could use some of Cole's coordination. My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now. I am just on maintenance. You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical cyclist. We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months. He never misses, rain or shine. Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial Park on Saturdays. Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the road. I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday. I would like to hear more about your new job. Maybe we could grab lunch sometime. Phillip", "id": "9572632_1075855690782_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
