It is not my desire for you to be left with out of pocket expenses. The only item from your list that I need further clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions. You mentioned that this was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash investment in the land. I agree that you should be refunded any cash investment. My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document. Phillip", "id": "24917543_1075855715301_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
