Subject: Phillip; These are just what I started with. I have not really fully looked at each spreadsheet for error in logic or other. I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to achieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new construction. And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on new construction strictly. I just am working on the best look as possible. I look forward to discussing this further.
