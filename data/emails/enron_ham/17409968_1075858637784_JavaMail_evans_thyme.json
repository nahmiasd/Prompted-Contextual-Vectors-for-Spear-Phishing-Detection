{"email_subject": "Bishops Corner", "email_body": "Phillip, I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week. If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of all of the documents. From a logistics standpoint this probably would be the best way to handle it. Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender. Sincerely, Greg Thorse", "id": "17409968_1075858637784_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
