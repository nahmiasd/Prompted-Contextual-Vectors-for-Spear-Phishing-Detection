The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 month from Dec00. CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. Thanks, Russ", "id": "7027353_1075857595396_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
