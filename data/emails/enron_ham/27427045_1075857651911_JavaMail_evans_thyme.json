{"email_subject": "Re: ng views", "email_body": "the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks. so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view. most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market. a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure. not convinced this rally in products is different.
