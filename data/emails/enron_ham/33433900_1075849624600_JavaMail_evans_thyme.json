{"email_subject": "Re: British Airways vs Continental", "email_body": "Fernley: We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways. I would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

I know there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if you need or want to know any of the detail.
