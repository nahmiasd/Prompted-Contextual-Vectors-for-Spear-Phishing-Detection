I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside. Can you find out when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price? What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal. Remember we have to get Brenda happy. Phillip", "id": "11482982_1075855688356_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
