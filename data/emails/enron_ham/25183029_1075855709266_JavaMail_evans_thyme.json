{"email_subject": "RE:", "email_body": "Jeff, Here is the application from SPB. I guess they want to use the same form as a new loan application. I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out if there is a shorter form. What do I need to be providing to the buyer according to the contract. I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey and a rentroll including deposits on Monday. Please let me know this morning what else I should be putting together.
