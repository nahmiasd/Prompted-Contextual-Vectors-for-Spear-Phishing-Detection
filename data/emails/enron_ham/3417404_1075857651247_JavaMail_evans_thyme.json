This morning I spoke to Wes regarding the placement of the Upstream/Ecommerce desk on six. I have taken 6 spaces but I need two more. The two I would like to use (e29 & e30) are currently being occupied by the Central Region. I would like to move these individuals to two spots right across from their current location (e35 & e36). For your information, the current six spots that I have are : e17, e18, e21, e22, e23 and e24. Please call when you can. Good luck trading... Regards, Mrha", "id": "3417404_1075857651247_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
