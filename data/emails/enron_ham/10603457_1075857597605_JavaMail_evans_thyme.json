John From: Jennifer Fraser 09/28/2000 03:35 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: PIRA Annual Seminar Preview Hey JA: I was at PIRA today and got a preview of their presenation on Oct 11-12 for their client seminars. (Greg Shuttlesworth) Summary: They have turned a little bearish becuase They believe that distillates will cap gas ( get some to graph HO, CL, NY No.6 1% and TZ6 Index and NX3) the picture is very convincing Supply is increasing at a faster pace (1Bcf/d more in Q4 and expect incremental 2 BCF/d next summer) Canadian production is increasing Deep water GOm is increasing Lastly, Shallow water GOM is also improving after years of decline Demand modest in 01/02 more efficient gas turbine economic moderation Near term Yes it looks a little ugly this winter Possibility of shocks in the shoulder ( low storage and early summer heat in Apr-May 01) Call me or write if you call for more details. I am also faxing you their fuel substitution slide---- it looks at up to 5 BCF/d being put back into the supply chain. Thanks JF", "id": "10603457_1075857597605_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
