Subject: kerrville If you decide to move to Kerrville I know of an excellent builder that I have worked with in the past. He has built numerous custom homes in the Kerrville\\Fredericksburg area that are very high quality. He has excellent long time crews using local German craftsmen. They do outstanding trim work and framing. Most of his houses are Texas style with solid rock walls, standing seam roofs, antique wood flooring, cabinets, etc. Let me know if you are interested.
