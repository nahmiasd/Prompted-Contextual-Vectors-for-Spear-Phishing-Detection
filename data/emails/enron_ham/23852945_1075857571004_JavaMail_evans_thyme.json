{"email_subject": "LNG Questions", "email_body": "Russ: A couple of questions 1- Check the DOE Northeast Heating season report. There seem to be a lot of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are the logistics of transportation etc... 2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of trucking LNG to CA. Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?
