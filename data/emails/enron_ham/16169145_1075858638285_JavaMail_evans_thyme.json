Current Notes User: REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA) 1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook c= lient will be configured on your computer. After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve ma= il via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is c= onfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is m= igrated. During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your= web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail. PLEASE NOTE: Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and T= o-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook cl= ient is configured on your desktop. 2.

You= will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below. Type in \"corp/your us= er id\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.= You will now be able to view your mailbox. =09 PLEASE NOTE: There are some subtle differences in the functionality betwee= n the Outlook and OWA clients.
