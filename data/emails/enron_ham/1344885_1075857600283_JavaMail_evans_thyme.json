Here is a networking opportunity for our international IDRC visitors to experience some warm Aussie hospitality. The Sydney Chapter would love to offer our international IDRC members an opportunity to combine the Olympics with a real Aussie Bush Barbeque in one of our National Parks close to Sydney. The Chapter has set aside Thursday, 14 September 2000 for an IDRC International \"Wine & Wisdom\" event in the form of a Bush BBQ. The time is 4:00 - 6:00 pm for a BBQ, a little informal information sharing, and some warm Aussie hospitality. Just let us know who you are, how we can contact you, your particular social or business interest, and we will be in touch with more detail. It's then up to you!
