However,at year end I will want to keep the debt off of my books. As we approach year-end this year could you please coordinate with Joe Deffner so that we take advantage of the margin lines we have available in order to minimize the debt on our books.

I have assumed Jeff's old responsibilities as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group. Our broker, EDF MAN, supplies us with $50 million of margin financing every night. They are trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30. They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th. We did this last year as well. Please advise, John", "id": "22568151_1075857597757_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
