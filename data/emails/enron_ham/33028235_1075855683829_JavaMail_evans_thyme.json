{"email_subject": "Re: Notices", "email_body": "Lucy, I got your email. I didn't have time to finish it. I will read it this weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's. I am glad you are enjoying the job. This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules. If I didn't mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Wade. Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week. Phillip", "id": "33028235_1075855683829_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
