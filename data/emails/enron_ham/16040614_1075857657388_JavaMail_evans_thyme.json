They have never indicated any interest in anything besides nymex or hub gas daily, but that may change. They have interest in trading on EOL but have not gotten approval yet. Caroline Abramo@ENRON 01/28/2001 03:37 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: smith barney AAA John- can you give me the name of your business line contact there, job function and phone number? Also, whatever you know about their trading style- are they macro, program, technical? Would they be interested in the same service we give Tudor, i.e do they want a salesperson to bring them ideas from our various trading groups?? Do they want to trade on-line or are they already?? Based on what you come back with, I'll give a call over there and see how I can resurrect the ISDA negotiations and get them trading... Talk to you Monday, CA", "id": "16040614_1075857657388_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
