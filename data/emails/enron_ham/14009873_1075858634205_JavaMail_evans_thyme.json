{"email_subject": "Revised Utility Construction Escrow Agreement - Lakeline Apts.", "email_body": "<<3M@X05!.DOC>> Phillip, Enclosed is a draft of the revised Escrow Agreement based on the Lender's comments. I am coordinating with the Lender regarding the reimbursement provisions in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement from Ryland. We may do a separate agreement between you, AMHP and McCall in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement. Please contact me at (512) 370-2836 or Michael Bobinchuck with any questions or concerns. Thanks. Michelle L.
