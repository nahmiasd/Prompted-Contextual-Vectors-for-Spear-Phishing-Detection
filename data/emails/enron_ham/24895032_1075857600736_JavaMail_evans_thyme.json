Thanks, John From: Vladimir Gorny 07/17/2000 07:30 PM To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: VaR Methodology Change Gentlemen, Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change related to forward-forward volatility: 1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk) - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. correlations (20 days vs. 60 days) - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0% 2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff 3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment (Research/IT) 4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders) 5. Migrate into production (Research/IT) Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. Vlady.", "id": "24895032_1075857600736_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
