The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff. I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday. I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day. This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30. Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week. Many thanks, Ina Rangel", "id": "21967225_1075858639217_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
