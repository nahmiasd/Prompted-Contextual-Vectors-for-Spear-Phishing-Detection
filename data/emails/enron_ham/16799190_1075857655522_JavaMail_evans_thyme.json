{"email_subject": "Re: Suspend switch", "email_body": "Would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is I can't operate stack manager. I need the ability to force everybody out of the website so people don't try to click numbers that are old. On a similar topic, what's the status of the out of credit message? Still a very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me. Do I need to follow up with Bradford about lowering sigma? Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk.

You might want to have it as a stand alone icon on your desktop in case you can't operate stack manager. When you have a second I'd like to talk about the broker EOL product and ED F Man. Congrats on a big day. Total EOL gas volume was 425BcF (!!).", "id": "16799190_1075857655522_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
