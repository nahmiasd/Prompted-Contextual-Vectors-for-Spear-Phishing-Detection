{"email_subject": "Re: Sept 1 Payment", "email_body": "Brenda, I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on August 28th. I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845. I will go ahead and mail you another check. If the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for October. I know your concerns about the site plan. I will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval. I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.
