{"email_subject": "Fedex", "email_body": "John: Good Morning! Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with an Enron counteroffer. Any news on this? Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop regarding: a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14; b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18 c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22 d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if necessary and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex. Appreciate it. Sarah-Joy", "id": "2877476_1075849627078_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
