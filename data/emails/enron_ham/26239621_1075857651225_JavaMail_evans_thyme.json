{"email_subject": "Re: Understanding the natural view", "email_body": "1. don't know. some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent. some will not come back at the same prices it went off. residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall. as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is. maybe #6 is the floor. 2. you know my outlook for xh, with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor. next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity. 3. the obvious 4. yes. believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced. my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y. circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall. 5. not necessarily. will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction. probably.

It gives perspective on 'normal relationships'. Things I need to clarify about your ng view 1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial shutdowns and fuel switchers)? 2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02 3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ? 4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6 is easy and that world did not end this past winter a storage level of 2.6? 5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this winter?
