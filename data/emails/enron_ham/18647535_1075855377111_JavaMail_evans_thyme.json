Why can't it continued to be operated on a reduced staff with out exercise classes? -----Original Message----- From: General Announcement/Corp/Enron@ENRON On Behalf Of Wellness@ENRON Sent: Friday, December 07, 2001 10:55 AM To: Enron Houston@ENRON Subject: Attention Body Shop Members -- UPDATE on Body Shop Closure The decision to close the Body Shop came after the December 15 payroll run, so you will incur a deduction on your December 15 paycheck. However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck. As a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers. Thank you.", "id": "18647535_1075855377111_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
