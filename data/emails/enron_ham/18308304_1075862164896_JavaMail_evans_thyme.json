Huntley, CFP\" <wise.counsel@lpl.com>@ENRON Sent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 3:19 PM To: Allen, Phillip K. Subject: Re: Huntley/question Phillip, It is looking like we will have to apply for a variance due to a set back requirement when building over 10 feet tall. Normal set back is 10 feet. For every 3 ft higher you go, another 5 feet is added to the set back. The garage would be about 20 ft so we'd normally need to be back about 25 ft. Currently, it's 13 feet. I'm going to look into what's involved in getting on the agenda for a variance. I'll let you know what I find out. Thanks, Bob Huntley ----- Original Message ----- From: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com> To: <wise.counsel@lpl.com> Sent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 5:21 AM Subject: RE: Huntley/question > Bob, > > I found the warranty deed but I could not find the title policy.
