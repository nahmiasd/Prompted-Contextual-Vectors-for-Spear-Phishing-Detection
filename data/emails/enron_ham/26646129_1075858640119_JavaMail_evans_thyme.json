Thanks, Jim -----Original Message----- From: Rainer, Eva Sent: Tuesday, June 19, 2001 4:08 PM To: Schwieger, Jim Cc: Wilson, Garry D.; Bieniawski, Paul; Higgins, Ned Subject: Crossroads Storage Project Jim, Following up on the message I left you, I thought I'd send you some of the basic information on the Crossroads project to see if you have any interest in that area: The facility will be a high flexibility, bedded salt cavern Initial startup is expected in summer 2002 with 2 bcf working gas, eventual rampup to 3 bcf 75 MMCF/D injection (at 2 bcf working) 200 MMCF/D withdrawal (at 2 bcf working) Located near Brush, Colorado, in Morgan County. Located at far east end of PSCo system, 7 miles from CIG and 10 miles from Kinder Morgan This is all the information I have at the moment, in addition to some maps which you are welcomed to look at. Garry Wilson and I will be meeting with the developer in Denver on Monday, but he'd like to see if we have interest sooner than that. I apologize for the last-minute nature of the request, but we were just hoping for an initial gauge of your interest. Do you have any use for this capacity? If so, at what price? What would your timing requirements be? Would you have any other conditions that would increase interest in this capacity? Thanks for your attention. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions, I'll try following up with you tomorrow if you ahve any free time. Thanks!
