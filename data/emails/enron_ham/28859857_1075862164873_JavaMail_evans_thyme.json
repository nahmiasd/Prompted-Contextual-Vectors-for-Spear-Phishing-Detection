{"email_subject": "RE: Exchange Documents", "email_body": "Jerry, I had a couple of questions about the exchange. 1. Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership? 2. The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K. At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K. Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest? 3. Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?
