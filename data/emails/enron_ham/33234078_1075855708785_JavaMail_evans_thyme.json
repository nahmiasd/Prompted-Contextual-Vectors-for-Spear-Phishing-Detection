While she is scheduled to rotate to the West desk soon, I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level. I'd like to meet at 2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue. Please let me know if this time fits in your schedules. Thanks, Larry", "id": "33234078_1075855708785_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
