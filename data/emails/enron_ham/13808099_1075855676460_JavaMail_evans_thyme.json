Is the closing today?? After reviewing the agreement?I find it isn't binding as far as I can determine.? It is too vague and it doesn't sound like anything an attorney or title company would?draft for a real estate closing--but, of course, I could be wrong.? ? If this?closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is no point in me following up on this?document's validity.? ? I will just need to go back to my closing documents and see what's there and find out where I am with that and deal with this as best I can. ? I guess I was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable document or something a little more exact, or rather?sort of a contract.? This isn't either.? I tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last night but he was out of pocket.? I talked to a crim. atty friend and he said this is out of his area but doesn't sound binding to him.? ? I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's transaction?and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even needed to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing. ? I really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn't seem to be something required for a closing.? In the event you do need my signature on something like this I would rather have time to have it reviewed before I accept it. ? Brenda ? ?", "id": "13808099_1075855676460_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
