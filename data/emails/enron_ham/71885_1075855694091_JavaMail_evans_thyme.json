Current Notes User: REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA) 1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer. After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated. During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail. PLEASE NOTE: Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop. 2. Remote access to your mailbox. After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox. PLEASE NOTE: At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN). There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad. HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA) Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type: Substitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER. You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below. Type in \"corp/your user id\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK. You will now be able to view your mailbox. PLEASE NOTE: There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients. You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook. Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA: Features NOT available using OWA: - Tasks - Journal - Spell Checker - Offline Use - Printing Templates - Reminders - Timed Delivery - Expiration - Outlook Rules - Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall - Sharing Contacts with others - Task Delegation - Direct Resource Booking - Personal Distribution Lists QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS? If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at: Outlook.2000@enron.com Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at: 713-853-1411 Thank you, Outlook 2000 Migration Team", "id": "71885_1075855694091_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
