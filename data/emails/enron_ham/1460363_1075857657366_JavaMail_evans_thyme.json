Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get her a pair of Rockets tickets. I know they are a playing the Clippers tommorrow night. I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it. Thanks, Errol, X5-8274", "id": "1460363_1075857657366_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
