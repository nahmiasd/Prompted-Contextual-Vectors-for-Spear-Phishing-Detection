Subject: Please Forward To Keith Hey Phillip, I have gone into travel planning mode and wanted to invite both you and Keith on a scuba expedition. Greg, our friend Larry Hudler and I are planning a trip to Fiji January 24th to Feb. 2nd. All in, the trip should be about $2,000. This includes Airfare, Condo, Diving, Food, and Drink, and maybe a little more drink. Let me know if either of you can attend. Darrell", "id": "4870333_1075855376808_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
