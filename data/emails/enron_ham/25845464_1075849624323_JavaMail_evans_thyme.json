I will be in attendance at 3:00 pm and have asked either Jim Crowder or Everett Plante to also attend. I do not know their availability yet due to the Enron PRC meeting conflicts. Is it possible for me to attend starting at 1:00 pm - I have not been through a complete Experience Enron meeting ? thanks again for your help.
