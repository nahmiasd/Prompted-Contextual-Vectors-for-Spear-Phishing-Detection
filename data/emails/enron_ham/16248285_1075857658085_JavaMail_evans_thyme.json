I went to Vandy but a little later... 1992-5. \"Piasio, Stephen [FI]\" <stephen.piasio@ssmb.com> on 01/11/2001 01:27:20 PM To: \"'jarnold@enron.com'\" <jarnold@enron.com> cc: Subject: credit facility Significant progress was recently made between Enron's and Salomon Smith Barney's counsels. We have offered Enron a $50 million facility that can be used for both original and variation margin. With these elevated NYMEX margins, I am sure it will help your P/L. Our counsel, Bob Klein is meeting with Citibank's attorneys to discuss some of the small issues where we both share some exposure. Citibank is one of your lead commercial banks while SSB is one of your lead investment banks. The relationship is so sound, we will work out the wrinkles. I'll be in touch. P.S. Someone told me you went to Vanderbilt..any chance 1988-1992ish?", "id": "16248285_1075857658085_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
