{"email_subject": "Re: Wade", "email_body": "Lucy, I want to speak to Wade myself. He can call me at work or home. Or if you email me his number I will call him. I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance. I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office. Do you need Mary to come in on any more Fridays? I think I can guess your answer. I might stop by this Friday. Phillip", "id": "18396036_1075855684027_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
