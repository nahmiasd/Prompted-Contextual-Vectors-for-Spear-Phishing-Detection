This standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data. Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before. A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you. There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format. The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables. You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards. ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which approach works best for you. Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession. They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't received the consideration they deserve. The standards are a great way to tell their story. If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the standards and their use.
