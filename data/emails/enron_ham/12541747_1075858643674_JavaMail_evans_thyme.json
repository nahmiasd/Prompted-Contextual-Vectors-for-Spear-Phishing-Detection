Subject: Arizona I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission. There are apparently concerns with interconnecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliability and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise. I don't know if this matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know.", "id": "12541747_1075858643674_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
