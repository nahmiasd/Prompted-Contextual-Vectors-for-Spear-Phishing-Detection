I want to get them into some gas and power trades. Specifically, I want to get them into the short Rockies trade for the summer that we have Tudor in. Johnny recommended I have you speak to them- can you give me a few minutes during the day to talk to them about the west in general. I have him in all day- we are sitting with Mike Roberts to do the weather update from 6 am-7:30 - would be great if we could get you between 7:30 and 8:30 am. If not, let me know when is good- Ina will know where I am Rgds, Caroline cell 917-324 1999", "id": "1477564_1075857570653_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
