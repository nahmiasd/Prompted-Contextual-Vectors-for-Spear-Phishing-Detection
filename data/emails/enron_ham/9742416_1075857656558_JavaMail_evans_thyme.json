{"email_subject": "Re: ....what happens at La Strada STAYS at La Strada!!!", "email_body": "imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one pipeline running to your well. the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way. split connect means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you don't have to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe. i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight. are you free saturday day and night? \"Jennifer White\" <jenwhite7@zdnetonebox.com> on 02/09/2001 11:42:51 AM To: john.arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: Re: ....what happens at La Strada STAYS at La Strada!!!
