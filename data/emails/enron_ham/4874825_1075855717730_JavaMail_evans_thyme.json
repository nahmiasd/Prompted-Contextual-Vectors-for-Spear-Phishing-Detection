{"email_subject": "Re: 32 acres", "email_body": "Jeff, That is good news about Leander. Now for the stage. I would like to get it sold by the end of March. I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach, it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven. I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien. I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet. These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown. Having Lucy show it is not a good idea. I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property. My dad doesn't have the time and I don't trust Lucy or Wade to show it correctly. I would prefer for you to show it from now on. I will have the operating statements complete through December by this Friday. Phillip", "id": "4874825_1075855717730_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
