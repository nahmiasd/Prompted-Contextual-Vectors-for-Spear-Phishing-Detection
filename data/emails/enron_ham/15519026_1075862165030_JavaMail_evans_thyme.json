{"email_subject": "RE: new PO available", "email_body": "Jim, I received your email on the Killeen post office. I am still having a tough time making the math work. Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment? Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.

I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come back on the market...it's in Killeen, and was under contract for about 30 days. But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so today he released this one. The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best we have had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friend of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turn down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract. I'm sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and can supply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me know soon...we will need to act quickly!
