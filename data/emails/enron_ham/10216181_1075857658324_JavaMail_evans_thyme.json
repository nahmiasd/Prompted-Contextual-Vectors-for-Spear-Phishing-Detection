{"email_subject": "Re:", "email_body": "I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, Tom). I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past. It's an issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone. Thanks for your help, John Ed McMichael 01/03/2001 08:37 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Thanks for the inquiry. I sincerely appreciate you giving me the heads up. As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and I am willing to let him interview for the job. As we talked about before, my only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he comes out on top. If there is any chance that his past will negatively influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview. He handled the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any more reasons to doubt his ability to overcome his past by working hard and proving himself here. He is very valuable to me and ENA. Please let me know. Ed John Arnold 01/02/2001 09:04 PM To: Ed McMichael/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Ed: I am starting options on EOL in about two weeks. As we discussed earlier, I don't have the appropriate manpower to run this in certain circumstances, such as when I'm out of the office. As such, I'd like to bring in John Griffith for anohter round of interviews for an options trading role with your permission. John", "id": "10216181_1075857658324_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
