Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term. As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages. It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way. The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless. the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful. if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way. what's switching vis a vis last year. whats production relative to last year. it simplifies the fundamental analysis.
