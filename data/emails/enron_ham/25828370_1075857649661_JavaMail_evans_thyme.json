If you get tails you win 0. if you get heads, i give you $1. Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money. however, each heads you get after the first you double your money. So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4. What's you bid/offer on playing this game? (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2? what you charge me play against you?)", "id": "25828370_1075857649661_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
