{"email_subject": "Re: Nymex NG Swaps", "email_body": "Andy: This past weekend we released a new version of the EOL software that, unfortunately, had a bug. The effect was to lengthen the time delay between numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades. We made the decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until the fix could be made. I do not anticipate this to be a concern going forward. Thanks for the feedback.
