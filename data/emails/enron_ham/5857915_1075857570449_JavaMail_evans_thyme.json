{"email_subject": "re:spreads", "email_body": "saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate margins/absolute position limits/var. as these guys are taking off the front, they are also buying back summer. el paso large buyer of next winter today taking off spreads. certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong on the way up and such a piece now. really the only one left with any risk premium built in is h/j now. it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning. certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked. certainly understand the arguments for h/j. if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10. H 20 call was trading for 55 on monday. today it was 10/17. the market's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that has to be reflected in h/j. slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/13/2000 04:15:51 PM To: slafontaine@globalp.com cc: John.Arnold@enron.com Subject: re:spreads mkt getting a little more bearish the back of winter i think-if we get another cold blast jan/feb mite move out. with oil moving down and march closer flat px wide to jan im not so bearish these sprds now-less bullish march april as well.", "id": "5857915_1075857570449_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
