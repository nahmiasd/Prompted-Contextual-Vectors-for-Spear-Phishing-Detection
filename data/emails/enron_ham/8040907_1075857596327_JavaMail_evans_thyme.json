We will be videotaping members of the Enron Executive Committee this week who will be sharing and swapping stories with each other about Enron's past. Then we will fast forward to today -- that's where you come in. We want each of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself. We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05. Please call or e-mail Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works best for you on either of these days. We expect the taping will only take 20 minutes or so. Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative. Thanks for your participation.", "id": "8040907_1075857596327_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
