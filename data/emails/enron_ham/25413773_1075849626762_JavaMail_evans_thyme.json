Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces. They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto. John and I discussed the opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS. EES is probably less likely, but it may be worth the investigation. I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in pursuing, and when. Thanks.
