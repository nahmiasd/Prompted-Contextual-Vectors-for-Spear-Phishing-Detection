{"email_subject": "Re: World Phone", "email_body": "Hey Liz, Thanks for letting me use the phone. A real life-saver. My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work better. It got reception some places where mine did not and is more user-friendly. On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a flight in December to Australia. He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for half. Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half. I haven't expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on.
