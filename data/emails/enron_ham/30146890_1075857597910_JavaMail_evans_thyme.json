Thanks, John \"Mark Sagel\" <msagel@home.com> on 09/26/2000 10:23:06 AM To: \"John Arnold\" <jarnold@enron.com> cc: Subject: natural update John: ? I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on my work.? All the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher levels.? I am receiving hourly \"9\" type strength patterns, which means the up move must consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows is a negative for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type of strength pattern today.? It is not a \"9\" type topping pattern, but one that normally comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would suggest a potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major importance. ? I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October 19.? Are you interested in meeting so that I may show in much greater detail what the work is doing and how it can enhance your activity?? Let me know if that day works for you.? Thanks, ?
