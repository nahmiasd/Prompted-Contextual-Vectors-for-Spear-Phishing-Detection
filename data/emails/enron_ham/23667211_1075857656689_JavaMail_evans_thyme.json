Problem is summer and on out so weak. trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 600. some customer selling in cal 2. so h/j and j/k need to blow out because no other spread is moving. i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to blow. all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly. it's a struggle each penny at this point. at least one spread needs to break if we're going to run and i don't see that happening. slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/08/2001 11:20:40 AM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: Re: spreads i think we rally a little from here this pm-that said i dont think mar/may gonna movre up much unless we see cash start to improve.. any thots on east cash? its a pig-of course no loads. whats gonna be the driver for march/apr from here you think?", "id": "23667211_1075857656689_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
