Mr. Golden was in the process of returning his call at approximately 2:15 p.m. Depending on what the two discussed will determine if FedEx needs to hold a conference call to discuss this further. If a conference call is needed, it will occur as soon as possible. The attendees will be FedEx employees. They are as follows: Carmen Perez, Corporate Account Executive Billy M. Golden Gary Stoops, Managing Director of Supply Chain Management Richard Roberts After FedEx holds the conference call, it will be determined if FedEx commercial and legal needs to meet with Enron commercial and legal. I understand if resolution does not take place prior to December 31, 2000 FedEx may not be Enron's carrier. Regards, Carmen Perez", "id": "3964476_1075849626739_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
