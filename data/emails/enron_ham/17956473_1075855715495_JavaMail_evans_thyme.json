{"email_subject": "RE: PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL COMPENSATION INFORMATION", "email_body": "Thanks for the information. It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January. I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock. I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%). Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account? Thank you for looking into this issue. Phillip", "id": "17956473_1075855715495_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
