The structure they are looking for is a firm physical sale at a NYMEX related price. There is a very good chance that they will do this all with one party. We are definitely being considered as that party. Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River. What would be your bid for this gas? ----- Forwarded by Mark Whitt/NA/Enron on 02/08/2001 03:13 PM ----- Tyrell Harrison@ECT Sent by: Tyrell Harrison@ECT 02/08/2001 03:12 PM To: Mark Whitt/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: AEC Volumes at OPAL", "id": "12786953_1075855716961_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
