{"email_subject": "Thank You", "email_body": "Phillip, I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today; I think we are getting to a good level of detail and we accomplished a lot today. I left a message for Ed and asked him to just focus on one or two difficult problems because we are planning to also include some of your \"easy\" problems in the simulation. We will look forward to getting the outlines for the remaining four scenarios from you early next week. Please let us know if something comes up and you don't think you'll be able to work on them. We'll call Ina with the room for next Friday. Thanks again for all your help, and have a great weekend.
