The roll out for phase II EOL is (for now) 8/28/00. Options are qeued next after that. Unfortu ately I wish I could give you a hard date, but it is out of my hands and in Jay Webb's shop. I am pushing as hard as I can but Louise has set phase II as the priority. I know this sounds like a lame excuse, but I don't know what else to say. The application is built, it just needs to be tested. Please don't get too frustrated and keep the pressure up on us. Andy", "id": "18076120_1075857599934_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
