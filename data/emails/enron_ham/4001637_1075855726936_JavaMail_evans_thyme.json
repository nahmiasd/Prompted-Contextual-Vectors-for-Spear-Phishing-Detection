{"email_subject": "Re: General Issues", "email_body": "Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip", "id": "4001637_1075855726936_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
