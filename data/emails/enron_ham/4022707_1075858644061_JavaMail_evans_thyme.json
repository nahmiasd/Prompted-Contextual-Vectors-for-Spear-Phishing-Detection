Have him call me directly and I will set something up. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Rangel, Ina Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 8:31 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Subject: Paul Margraves Meeting Paul Margraves would like to come here and meet with you at 1:30 this Friday. He says it would be a quick 15 minute general meeting. I put him on your calendar and told him if something needed to change I would call him back. Is this okay with you? -Ina", "id": "4022707_1075858644061_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
