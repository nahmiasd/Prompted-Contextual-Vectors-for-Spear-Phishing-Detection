Sent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 9:48 AM To: Webb, Jay Subject: RE: simulation environment Jay, My message was confusing. I needed one more id that has access to all products. It is for the use of someone on the West Desk. I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region. If possible, please modify simtrader7. Thank you, Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Webb, Jay Sent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 7:06 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Subject: RE: simulation environment Hi Phillip, simtrader7 has access to all US gas (physical and financial) and all West power. Gas access is not regionalized, so I can't give the account access to just West gas. Let me know if this isn't what you want. Thanks! --jay -----Original Message----- From: Allen, Phillip K.
