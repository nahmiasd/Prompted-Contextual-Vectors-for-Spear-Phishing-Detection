{"email_subject": "Re: Houston Street", "email_body": "Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system not supplying us with that info. Andy Zipper@ENRON 07/31/2000 01:51 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Houston Street John, As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your thoughts/concerns. -Andy", "id": "13443589_1075857600218_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
