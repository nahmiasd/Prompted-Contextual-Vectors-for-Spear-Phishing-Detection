Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to be effective in interviewing Gas Traders. Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order to help her screen some candidates. It would be great if you could respond to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select good Gas Traders. Thanks for your help.
