{"email_subject": "Holiday party", "email_body": "I know it will be close to impossible to get out but I wanted to invite you to our Christmas party on Dec 20 here in NYC- we'd love if you came. If not, in the new year, I hope we can set something up where you meet some of the new funds we are dealing and have some fun up here. I met someone good to work with you guys at this last Super Saturday- David Larson- Berkeley- good derivatives, trading knowledge, personable. I'll fax through resume- we are making him an offer for the analyst pool. Thanks for all you help always, Caroline", "id": "31247780_1075857570782_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
