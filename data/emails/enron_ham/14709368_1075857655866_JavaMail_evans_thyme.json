{"email_subject": "RE: Buying back calls", "email_body": "Michael: Thanks for putting the paperwork together. I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don't have access to now. Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable. The above services provide no value to me personally. If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen.

At some point, I'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?

However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to really trade around the position. I believe ENE will continue to be range bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium. I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy. To that regards, I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls. I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options. Please look into that for me.

Of course, you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce. I'm not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73. Call me if you're interested.
