{"email_subject": "Re: How are you today", "email_body": "Adam: Hope your interview goes well. Things are going crazy in the gas market so, unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews. As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview. Be confident. Answer the question asked. Don't be afraid to say you don't know but don't make excuses. Express interest in why you find Enron appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing. The trading training program is still in the works. Few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews. If you receive an offer, it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive. Not sure about that last statement though. The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas: gas and power. There are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program. That's a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses. Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet. Write me about how your interviews went.

You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers. Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program? You mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year entail? I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look forward to seeing you again. Do you have any tips on approaching the interview process? I have poured over the company website, and if you have any tips I would love to hear them. Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday. Cordially, Adam Bayer", "id": "4555533_1075857596131_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
