It was an excellent start to developing the significant opportunities that will benefit both GSS and NEPCO. I look forward to continuing to work with you to deliver value to the NEPCO bottom line. I have attached meeting minutes from last Thursday's meeting, including action items for some of the areas we discussed. One of the action items is to set a follow up in January for a GSS analytical team to gather data in your offices, and to begin developing specific supply strategies. I met with the other SPLs this morning and identified the team members we would plan to send. At the moment we would like to target January 30th and 31st for our follow-up. I will work with the team to develop a specific agenda for that visit and will forward it to you by January 8th. Please let me know if you have any additions, deletions or changes to the attached minutes. Happy Holidays, Roy Hartstein Director, Sourcing Portfolio Leader Global Strategic Sourcing", "id": "10256573_1075849627320_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
