We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked great. You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up. The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded. We could keep it between you and Mike. We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them who will need quicker execution. I know you and Per have discussed the idea of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer. I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an update of who we are planning to trade with. Best Rgds, Caroline", "id": "5595491_1075857571225_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
