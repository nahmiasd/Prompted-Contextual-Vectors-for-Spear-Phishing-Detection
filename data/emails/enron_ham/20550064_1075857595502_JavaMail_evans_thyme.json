I informed Jay that it was in violation of their agreement to \"sell, lease, retransmit, redistribute or provide directly or indirectly,any portion of the content of the Website to any third party.\" They indicated that they had provided the id to one of their marketers in New England. They also suggested that they had a broker that watched spreads for a commission therefore theoretically the broker was an employee of the company.
