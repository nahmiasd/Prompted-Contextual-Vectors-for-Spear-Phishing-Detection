Cc: Walsh, Kristin; Tholan, Scott; Whitman, Britt; Holman, Kelly Subject: El Paso 1110 Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues. As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review. Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st. We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st. We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week. We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.
