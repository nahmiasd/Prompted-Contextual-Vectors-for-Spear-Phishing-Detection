{"email_subject": "Re: Stress Testing", "email_body": "Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter. In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200. The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently. But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on. Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20% $ -.05 40% $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1 Enron North America Corp.

For example, one test could be called \"hurricane\", were the prompt month is \"stressed\" on both price and vols, holding all other inputs constant. Anyway, I would like to know of any likely/realistic stress scenarios you can think of.... Let me know, Frank", "id": "15042778_1075857600714_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
