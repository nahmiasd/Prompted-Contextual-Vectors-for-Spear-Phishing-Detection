{"email_subject": "RE: Amerex - Scott Halprian", "email_body": "Andy, I don't know what your need for brokerage services are, but Scott is nice enough as far as brokers go. Personally, I am extremely pleased with the transition to online platforms and find that I can get 90%+ of my business done online. If you have a need for brokers, Scott is a good choice.

Subject: Amerex - Scott Halprian Hi guys, We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market. I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here. He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe. Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute? Many thanks Andy", "id": "7688871_1075862164719_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
