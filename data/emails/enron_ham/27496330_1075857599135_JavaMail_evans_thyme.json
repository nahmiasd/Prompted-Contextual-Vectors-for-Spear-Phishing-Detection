Thanks, John From: Suzanne Nicholie @ ENRON 08/29/2000 05:11 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Paula Harris/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Meeting to discuss 2001 direct expense plan Hi John, Since Jeff has left I am assuming that you will be responsible for the plan for your cost center - 105894. Please correct me if I am wrong. I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading. I will have a schedule that details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and a template for the 2001 plan. I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you tomorrow: 1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount? If so, what level of person? 2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001? 3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center? 4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want to plan for? 5) Are you expecting any promotions? 6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement agencies? Would we need to plan relocation costs for them? 7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries? 8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should plan for? If so, how much and where? 9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, monitors and software? 10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.) My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished before Paula Harris took over. She will be coming to the meeting with me. Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the meeting. Thanks! Suzanne", "id": "27496330_1075857599135_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
