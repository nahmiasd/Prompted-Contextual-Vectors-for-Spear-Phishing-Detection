Saves on gas, pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy. Enron provides bike racks in the front of the building for requests such as this. Phillip, I wish we could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily basis. If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike at the designated outside racks. Keep Pedalling - Lee", "id": "13421052_1075855673702_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
