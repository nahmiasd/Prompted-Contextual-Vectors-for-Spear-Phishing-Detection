Its been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened. But the most important thing has been my decision to join Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation, and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations. I am wondering if you know some people in these areas who might be looking for analysts. I have heard that traders work closely with the structured finance and RAC guys, true? If you have time please let me know if you know of anything. Thanks, Adam Bayer", "id": "29352074_1075857650639_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
