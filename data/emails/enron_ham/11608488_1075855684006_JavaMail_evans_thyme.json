{"email_subject": "Re: The New Power Company", "email_body": "Scott, I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company. I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him. Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider. Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk. This is my best guess. I will get back to you with more.
