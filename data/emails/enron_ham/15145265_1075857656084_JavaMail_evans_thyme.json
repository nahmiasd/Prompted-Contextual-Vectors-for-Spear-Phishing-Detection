{"email_subject": "Re: US Spread Product", "email_body": "Looks good except for settlement period. Industry standard and for ease to Enron, a spread trade is treated as two separate trades. Therefore, there will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction. The file below states settlement period is 5 days after both legs have been set. Please change to 2 settlement periods, 5 days after each respective leg has been set. John Enron North America Corp.
