They have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000. Could you give me a basis for the period : Sept -00 - May 31, 2006 Sept-00 - May 31, 2008 Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an adjustment to one of these point. Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread be on these terms. Thanks, Mike", "id": "20457011_1075855689790_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
