Hope you did not know anyone involved. Thought I would share my recent accomplishment with you, given you have pretty much known me since I did my first Triathlon at Cinco Ranch about 4 years ago now I believe. Did my first ironman last Saturday up at Lake Geneva in Wisconsin. Very long day and the hardest thing I have ever done, but I finished which was my ultimate goal. I would gladly trade it in to bring back some of the lost souls from Tuesday, but unfortunately I do not have that power. Hope everything is splendid with you.
