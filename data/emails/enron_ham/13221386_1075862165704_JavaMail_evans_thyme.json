I want to take a few minutes to summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting. 1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you gave us and move forward with this approach. 2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for sign-off on each topic. 3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail Monday with the room number.) Have a good weekend.
