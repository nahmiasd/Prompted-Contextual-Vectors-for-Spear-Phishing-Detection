{"email_subject": "Quotes for the CD's.", "email_body": "Jennifer, In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference. However, after speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case. The CDs are not included in this figure. The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is currently being tabulated).
