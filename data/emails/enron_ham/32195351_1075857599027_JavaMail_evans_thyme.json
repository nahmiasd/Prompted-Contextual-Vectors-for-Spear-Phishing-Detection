Things are going well here . The big E just chugging along, bringing the stock price with it. Wish I could tell you everything new in my life, but I think I just did.

Is this \"the 26-year-old chief of natural-gas derivatives\"? If so, you should write me back after you complete your \"nine hours and $1 billion in trades\" today!!
