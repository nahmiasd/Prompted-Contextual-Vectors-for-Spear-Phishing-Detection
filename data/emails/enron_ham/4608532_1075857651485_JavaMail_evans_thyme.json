Would that be you? Or do you have a legal department that we should forward it to? We initially changed the name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it has to be under your departments name and we need someone to sign the contract. Let me know.

I noticed the contracts have been received. However, \"North America\" has been crossed off the contract. That is the name it was signed under and still the current trading name for Emissions and Natural gas. Not sure if it was a mistake or not. Anyway - please get back to me when you can. I am going to try to set up a meeting with the gas guys for tomorrow 4/17. Thanks", "id": "4608532_1075857651485_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
