I'm helping Research (and Toim Barkley) with a data visualization tool for EOL trades, and I wanted for you to know I'd like to make this product helpful for you. In doing so, I'd like to also let my colleagues Chris Gaskill/Hunter Shively avail themsevles of this tool. But, I need to find out if the desks are your colleagues or, as things shape up, your competitors, since some trades are between Enron desks. Can Chris/Hunter see synopses of all of our EOL gas trades, after the fact? Clayton Vernon", "id": "18917089_1075857653085_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
