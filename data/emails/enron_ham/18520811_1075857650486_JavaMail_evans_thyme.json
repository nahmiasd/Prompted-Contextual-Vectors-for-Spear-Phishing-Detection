I would speak in such generalities that it probably wouldn't be a good interview. John Jennifer Walker@ENRON 05/07/2001 08:57 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RISK Magazine Interview John: Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in Enron's opinion of: 1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades 2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer? 3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market? If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you. Thanks for your help and please call me with any questions.
