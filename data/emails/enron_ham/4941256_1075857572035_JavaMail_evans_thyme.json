{"email_subject": "Fuel Switching", "email_body": "The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It also details one of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost and quality of generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and deregulation at the state level. - NGM11_00.pdf", "id": "4941256_1075857572035_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
