From: Sunil Dalal @ ENRON 09/20/2000 04:05 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Frank Hayden/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: John, the matrix that was sent to you includes YTD P&L for all the traders in the matrix. Trader P&L contribution to desk P&L, however, was not backed out on that particular matrix. That matrix effectively shows one trader's correlation to all others. What is does not show is one trader's P&L to the desk P&L. I have included a spreadsheet with each trader's P&L backed out of AGG-GAS P&L to demonstrate their relationship. Please call Frank or myself if you have questions. Thanks.

In other words, is my P&L correlated with the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me? Enron North America Corp.
