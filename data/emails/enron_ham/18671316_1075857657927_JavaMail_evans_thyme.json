The ideas generated from this group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the markets we manage. In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote aggressive ideas. Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open forum for discussion. Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation. Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.", "id": "18671316_1075857657927_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
