Further, the flow we see gives us an advantage in the market. We have little interest in distributing this info outside of the building. I hope you understand. Good luck to your brother. David Pruner@AZURIX 10/06/2000 09:03 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: options information I run the structuring group at Azurix, but I am emailing you in reference to my brother-in-law, Scott Adams, who is based in New York City. Since graduating from Brown University he has traded options on the floor in New York as a local for the last 8 years. He trades natural gas options and is looking to occassionally do an information exchange with someone where he can discuss the OTC market versus what he sees going on in the ring. If this would be of interest or not let me know and I will hook you two up. Thanks for your time. Dave Pruner 713-646-8329", "id": "1280210_1075857597127_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
