All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great Lakes area by the last half of the period. This shift allows for cold Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American). The Canadian and European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping them warmer and away from the cold. The American eliminates this southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period. The European appears to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases, the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period. All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air. More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be available with the 6:30am ET release. -Matt Rogers", "id": "6155033_1075857656754_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
