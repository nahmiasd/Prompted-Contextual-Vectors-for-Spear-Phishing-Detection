Unfortunately, that process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate. Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA. Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to be held the first week of Jan. I would like to handle all of these consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this discussion. I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process. Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the title change. Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest convenience. If you need my assistance with this please let me know. I apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions. Please contact me with any questions/concerns. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeanie Slone/HOU/ECT on 12/19/2000 09:21 AM --------------------------- people.finder@ENRON 12/19/2000 09:19 AM Sent by: Felicia Buenrostro@ENRON To: Dutch.Quigley@enron.com cc: Jeanie Slone/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: PeopleFinder Feedback Dutch, Unfortunately, I cannot make that change for you.
