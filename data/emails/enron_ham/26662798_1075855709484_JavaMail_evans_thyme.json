They do not want the school to come back at a later date for something different. Doug Bell will meet with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the subject. It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF wants something in writing to that effect. I spoke to AMF's attorney today, and explained the situation. They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied. AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after the March 29 hearing. We may close this deal in April. The Stage is still on go. An assumption package has been sent to the buyer, and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the details to Wayne McCoy. I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week. I will be checking my messages.
