{"email_subject": "FW: Curve Shift File", "email_body": "Jeff, JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L. Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million. This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached. The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million). This is probably money coming out of reserves. Besides that day there are many smaller differences. Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days? The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Port, David Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 11:28 AM To: Allen, Phillip K.
