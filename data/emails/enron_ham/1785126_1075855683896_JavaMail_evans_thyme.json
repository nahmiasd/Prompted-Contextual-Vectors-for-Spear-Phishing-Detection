The enclosed version contains deltas and decision variable. You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so. This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the model. I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor. The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation very well. The Enron Research storage model is a lot like that, although implementation may be different. Let me know if you have any questions. Zimin", "id": "1785126_1075855683896_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
