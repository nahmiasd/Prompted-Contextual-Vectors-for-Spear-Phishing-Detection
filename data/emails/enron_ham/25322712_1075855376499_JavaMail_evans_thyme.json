{"email_subject": "FW: Wishing you well", "email_body": "As some of you might already know, I resigned today. I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron. Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people. I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January. I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life. As always, it has been a pleasure working with you! Keep in touch. I will be interested to see what happens. Carole C.
