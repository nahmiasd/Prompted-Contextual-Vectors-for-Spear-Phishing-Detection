They want to know this for nat gas: I can talk to John and Mike on this Rus- can you please get this on WTI, heat, and unleaded. I want to try to get this to them today... we'll be getting a lot of these inquiries. Also, they trade through Carr futures, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, and JPM/Chase.. What they want to do is trade with us and then we'll give-up the trades to the above counterparties.. in effect, we will not have any credit exposure..I can explain this in our meeting.
