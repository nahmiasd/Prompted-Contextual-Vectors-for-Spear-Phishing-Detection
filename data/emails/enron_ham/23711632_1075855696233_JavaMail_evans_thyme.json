According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however. More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.", "id": "23711632_1075855696233_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
