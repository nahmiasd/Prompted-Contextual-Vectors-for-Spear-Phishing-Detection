{"email_subject": "Summary of Today's Meeting", "email_body": "Phillip, Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting: 1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type. 2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next week to gather content and a second meeting for review. 3. We will change \"Gas Daily Risk\" to \"Intra-Month Risk\" throughout the simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk? 4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too? Thank you in advance for your help. Have a great Thanksgiving. Mery This message is for the designated recipient only and may contain privileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.
