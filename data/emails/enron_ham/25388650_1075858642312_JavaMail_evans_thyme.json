Phillip, I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing both the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both documents to me. Enclosed please find the Deed and the First Amendment. Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your possession. I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make sure that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version. Also enclosed is the First Amendment. The only change to this document from the version I e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of \"June 29, 2001\" as the date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000 Extension Fee. Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address described below. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at (512) 370-2836 or Mike Bobinchuck at (512) 703-5000. Thanks. Michelle L.
