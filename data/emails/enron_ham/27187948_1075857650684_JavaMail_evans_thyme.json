He is concerned about the usage of the Fimat line because the trading volume is not covering its costs. He wanted to know how to increase business with Enron. I referred him to you. As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line. Will you please address this with him? Thanks, Sarah", "id": "27187948_1075857650684_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
