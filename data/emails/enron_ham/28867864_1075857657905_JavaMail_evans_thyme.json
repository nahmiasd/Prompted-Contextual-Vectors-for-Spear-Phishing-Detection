Liz M Taylor 01/17/2001 11:49 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Destiny's Child Hi John, Destiny's Child is performing at the LiveStock & Rodeo Show on Sunday, Feb. 18. I have two little nieces who are huge fans. I would love to take them to the show. I was wondering if you could use your broker contacts for some really great seats( 4 to 8)(indivdual or in a suite) I'm more than willing to pay for the tickets. I'll take care of you down the road w/Rockets, Astros and Texan ticket! Liz", "id": "28867864_1075857657905_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
