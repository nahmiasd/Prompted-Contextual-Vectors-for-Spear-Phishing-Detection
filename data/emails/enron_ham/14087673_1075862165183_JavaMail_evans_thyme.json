{"email_subject": "RE:", "email_body": "I would like to achieve a yield of 5%. I am expecting an average maturity date of 2020. Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effective yield only 3.8%? Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?

Subject: Phillip, Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx. $785,000) for your muni bond portfolio. After the treasury comes due on Jan 31, 2002, you will have another $750,000. You really don't have to worry about your margin requirements because you still get 80% of the value of your municipals credited towards marginable securities. So, the bottom line is 785m right now. Jan 31, 2002 another 750m. One thing to keep in mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there. Unless you close that position you will probably get put those. Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for. Also, if there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such as duration, maturity, etc. Steve Notice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions: Please do not transmit orders and/or instructions regarding your UBSPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.
