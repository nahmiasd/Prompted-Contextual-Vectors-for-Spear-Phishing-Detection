{"email_subject": "RE: West Gas Headcount", "email_body": "Faith, Two changes need to be made to the list. First, Jason Wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk. Second, Matt Lenhart should be an Associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and Randy G. I don't know if this change can be made administatively or if I need to bring this up during PRC. Please let me know.
