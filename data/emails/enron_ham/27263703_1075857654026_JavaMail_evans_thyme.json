I need a vacation desperately! I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the Guggenheim events. Will you look over this document and tell me which ones you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!! Thanks honey!
