We'll talk later, John \"Mark Sagel\" <msagel@home.com> on 10/03/2000 02:29:47 PM To: \"John Arnold\" <jarnold@enron.com> cc: Subject: Natural update John: ? The price behavior of the past couple days has been disappointing.? My short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price rally and natural appears to be waning at present.? Volume on this rally is poor, particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? The market appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? If we are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely bullish.? Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.? Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural.? Bigger picture is still very bullish.? However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move to the upside. ? Let me know if this stuff is useful for you.? I certainly don't want to waste your time.? In addition, if you prefer I call when I have something to pass along, let me know.? I don't know how often you check/see your e-mail.? Thanks, ?
