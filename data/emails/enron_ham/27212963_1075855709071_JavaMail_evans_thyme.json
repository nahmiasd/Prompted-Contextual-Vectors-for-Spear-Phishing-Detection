If they can really build this many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis. Obviously it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand. Even if it is subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.
