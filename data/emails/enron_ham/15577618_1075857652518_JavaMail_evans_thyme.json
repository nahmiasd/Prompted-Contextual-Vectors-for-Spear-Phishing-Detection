{"email_subject": "Re: Monday Conference Call", "email_body": "Mike: Two questions regarding fees: 1. What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type investment into the hedge funds? 2. I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity. However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that Fidelity charges $147.50. Is there any justification? Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber is dependent upon an agressive fee structure. I don't want to see my above-market returns compromised by high fees. Thanks, John", "id": "15577618_1075857652518_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
