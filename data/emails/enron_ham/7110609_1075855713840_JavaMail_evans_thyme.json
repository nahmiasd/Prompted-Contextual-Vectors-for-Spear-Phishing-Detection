{"email_subject": "Re: Unocal WAHA Storage", "email_body": "Ned, Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value. The following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees. Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year). Demand charges only. I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not. Please call or email with comments. Phillip Allen", "id": "7110609_1075855713840_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
