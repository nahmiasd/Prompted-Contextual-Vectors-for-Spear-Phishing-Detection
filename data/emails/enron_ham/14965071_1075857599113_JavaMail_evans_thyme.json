I'm minding my own business sitting on the dooker reading Time, and sure enough i get picked off! Sheeeeeeeeeet. Friggin celebrities. Can I have your autograph? :) Nice work, dood. Fellas, I believe the new job is almost here--i was told yesterday that I got the job and am just waiting for the phone offer (supposed to happen this afternoon). If it comes through, I'll be covering the internet--should be pretty solid. Who knows, if EnronOnline gets spun off (obv, not gonna happen) I might even get to cover it... what a mock! Anyway, thought I'd drop you two a line. Hope things are going well... can't wait for football... lemme know when you boys come back out here...
