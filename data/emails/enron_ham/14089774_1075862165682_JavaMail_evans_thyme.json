Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 11:10 AM To: 'med@dyalroberts.com' Subject: Mike & Tony, Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs. Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close. I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis. I don't know if this would be agreeable to you. Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think. If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections. I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors. We are torn between two good locations. However, we are leaning towards Kerrville. The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially. We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to our plan to move to San Marcos. I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.
