Phillip -----Original Message----- From: James Wills <jwills3@swbell.net>@ENRON Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 1:38 PM To: pallen70@hotmail.com; pallen@enron.com Subject: Re: new PO available Phillip, Carlos and I will try to respond to your request for a spreadsheet in the next day or two (I'll be at the home office in New Braunfels tomorrow). Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on some news...the Killeen post office probably is gone...I wrote a contract this morning that's now on its way to California for signature. Of course, if you wanted to submit one also, we can do it fairly quickly. Incidentally, I had the price wrong on Killeen...it's $1,377,550, not $1,360,000. HOWEVER!! Here's info about another new listing that may be ideal for you; it's a brand new post office at CANYON LAKE, just north of SA, and in a really ideal location to serve all the small communities that surround the reservoir. I have attached a flyer for you...this one, like Killeen, will not be around long because there are other brokers promoting it. I have talked to the postmaster, who tells me that almost all the boxes are gone, and the building is just now ready for occupancy. CPS is connecting over 2200 new power boxes a month in the area. It's really growing. Let me know what you think!! With best regards, Jim Wills Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com wrote: > Jim, > > I received your email on the Killeen post office.
