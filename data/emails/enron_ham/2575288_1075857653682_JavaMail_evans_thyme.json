This invitation is extended to anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa= st=20 two years. These informal, interactive forums will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year. Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have= =20 indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20 mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues. They= =20 also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i= ts=20 executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, = create a=20 =01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the= =01&same=20 page=018 about where Enron is going---and why. To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions: Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below. Yo= u=20 will attend only one session.) ______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M ______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work: ? Each session will have approximately 20 participants. ? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue. ? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20 presentations.=20 ? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20 questions and express your own opinions. ? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum= . ? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20 limited to: the direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activitie= s,=20 projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,= =20 values, etc. Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20 encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20 intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d= o=20 the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20 you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20 Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20 Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these= =20 sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing, as to what session you will attend. We will try to honor requests for firs= t=20 choices as much as possible. =20 Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20 e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com). Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806= . Thank you.", "id": "2575288_1075857653682_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
