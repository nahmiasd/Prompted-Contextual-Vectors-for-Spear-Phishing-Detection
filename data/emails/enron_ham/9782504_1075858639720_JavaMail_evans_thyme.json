He said that he would do a preliminary design for permitting only and as soon as he gets the new geotech information showing the actual borings where the buildings are actually going to go, he will revise his foundation designs. He is in the process of sending us a revised proposal showing the additional costs to do this extra designing. Any questions, please call me. Thanks.
