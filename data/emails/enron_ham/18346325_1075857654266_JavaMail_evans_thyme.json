PR and Eric Thode recommended that I drop you and email with respect to a question I have about specific trade types that no one seems to know the answer to. I wanted to know if you knew what ST and MLT trades are and just so you know, in case it makes a difference, these are in context to French power trading. I know you are extremely busy but if you get a chance I would greatly appreciate your comments. Thanks, Ann x54694", "id": "18346325_1075857654266_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
