{"email_subject": "Plastics & Petrohemicals - Universal", "email_body": "Jennifer, I just spoke with Lee Jackson, Enron Plastics and Petrochemicals, in regard to Universal Studios. He did not feel Universal's plastic spend would be in the range their group would consider for a prospect. Lee said their main clients are chemical companies/producers. He mentioned a typical usage would be 1 Billion Lbs/yr in polymers and 5-10 MM Lbs/year in polymers large users. I also briefly mentioned EP&P possibly coming to do an overview training for us. I mentioned this to Sarah-Joy and she said she would schedule something through Alan Engberg beginning next year. Colleen", "id": "17381877_1075849626614_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
