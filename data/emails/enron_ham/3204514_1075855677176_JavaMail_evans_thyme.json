My last report showed an online date of May 2001; the actual anticipated online date is May 2003. The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have access to in the WSCC: 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona. 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.", "id": "3204514_1075855677176_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
