I think publishing independent market evaluations could be beneficial. The more interesting content that is published, the better. From: Rahil Jafry 08/28/2000 07:48 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: EnronOnline Hey John, We'd briefly spoken on the phone last week, but I haven't been able to come by and talk to you like I'd promised. Louise had mentioned you did not like Cynthia Kase's newsletter and may not want us to put Cynthia's weekly summaries on EnronOnline. Since Fred (Lagrasta) and his group think publishing her summaries on EnronOnline will attract more of the smaller customers, would you have any objection over us publishing the Kase newsletters. Pls. let me know ASAP so we can proceed with this further. Regds., Rahil x. 3-3206", "id": "12941463_1075857599243_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
