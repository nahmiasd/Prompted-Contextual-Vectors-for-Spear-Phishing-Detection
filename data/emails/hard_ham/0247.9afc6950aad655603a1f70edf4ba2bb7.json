{"email_subject": "Securing multiple virtual hosts", "email_body": "I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.\nWe are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are\nmerely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.\nWe are not running any secure applications on the root host.\n\nI have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate\nrequests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's\ngrasp of the commands and command line options.\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure\nvirtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each\nof the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?\n\n2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I\ncorrect in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body\nof httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host\nin the <Virtual . . .> section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the\nanswer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.\n\n3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our\nusers, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server\ncertificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be\nnecessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be\na good idea given our scenario?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nOpenSSL Project                                 http://www.openssl.org\nUser Support Mailing List                    openssl-users@openssl.org\nAutomated List Manager                           majordomo@openssl.org\n\n"}
