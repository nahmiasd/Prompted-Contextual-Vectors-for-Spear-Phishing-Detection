{"email_subject": "[ILUG-Social] Re: Important - reenactor insurance needed", "email_body": "My gut reaction would be to tell them to go and shite, but this might not help to solve the problem. People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote. What about finding out what they are prepared to insure, and then tell them that you are pulling in your horns and will do what you are insured to do, and make sure no one chops up any one else.
