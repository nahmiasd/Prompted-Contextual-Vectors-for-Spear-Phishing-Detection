Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).\n\nAdditional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral\narguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court\nJudge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.\nLinks:\n\nFor this release:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/MGM_v_Grokster/20020909_eff_pr.html\n\nDocuments related to Metro-Goldwyn Mayer v.

The festival will be held in Golden Gate\nPark's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon\n- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful\nDead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of\nthe late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.\n\nArtists participating in this event will permit recording of their\nperformances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio\nLicense (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set\nDuo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,\nceltic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band\nAtticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.\n\nIn addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including\nAshley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,\nFrantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his\nSideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!\n\nBen and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel\nCatering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.\n\nProceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for\nAudiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as\nthe Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in\ncyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual\ntechnologies.\n\nThe Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to\nhelp artists share music more directly with their fans, without\nsacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages\ncollaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business\nmodel strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free\nsoftware initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages\nartists to share with one another and their fans\n\nAdoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their\nwork. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks\nor performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without\nrelying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music\ndistribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.\nThe Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for\npackaging and distributing music, which is where record companies\ncurrently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF\nis committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control\nover their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.\n\nWhen: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm\n\nWhere: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the\nJapanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive\n\nMore Information and Travel Directions:\nhttp://www.eff.org/events/share-in/\nLinks:\n\nEFF's Cafe Project:\nhttp://www.eff.org/cafe/\n\nThe Open Audio License:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/Open_licenses/eff_oal.html\n\n- end -\n\n\n*Help With Our Internet Blocking in Schools Study\n\nIf you know of any public school students, teachers, school\nadministrators, school board members, parents, or recent public school\nalumni in the United States who are willing to speak about the impact\nof Internet blocking on educational opportunities, the EFF would like\nto make contact with them.
