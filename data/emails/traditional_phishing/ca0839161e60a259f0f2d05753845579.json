We have a  business proposal for you. This is after due deliberation with my partners.  We believe that you would be in a position to work with us in our bid to  transfer the sum of Forty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars (US$10.8M) into\u00a0your account since you do not live in our  Country.\u00a0 This transaction\u00a0is 100% legal and no risk involved.  We are members of the special committee for budget and planning of  the Ministry of Petroleum. This committee is principally concerned with  contract appraisals and approval of contracts in order of priorities as  regards CAPITAL PROJECTS of the Federal Government of Nigeria. With our  positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of Forty-one  Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars(US$41.5M). We  are working with the present Democratically elected Government in my  country, and we are seeking the support of Foreign Government to win the  next election coming up in the year 2007, which the race has started. So  they have given directive to all Federal Parastatals to settle all Foreign  Contractors being owed for contract that they have done. Therefore, our plan  is to include your name as one of the contractors being owed in our  corporation. What we need from you is to provide a safe Account into  which the funds will be transferred since Government Officials in my country  are not allowed by our laws to Operate Foreign Accounts. It has been agreed  that you will be compensated with US$8.3 Million of the remitted funds.  US$31.125Million belongs to us, while\u00a0 US$2.075Million will be set  aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes. It may  interest you to know that two years ago a similar transaction was carried  out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, the C.E.O of Crane International Trading  Corporation at number 135, East 57th street, 28th floor, New York 10022,  with Telephone (212)308-7788 and Telex Number 6731689. After the agreement  between both of us in which he was to take 25% of the money as his share,  the money was duly transferred into his Account. We were disappointed on our  arrival in New York as we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was  no longer on that address while his Telephone and Telex Numbers have been  reallocated to somebody else. That was how we lost US$27.5M to Mr.Patrice  Miller.This time around we would not want you to be like that. We  need a more reliable and trustworthy person and a reputable Company to do  this business with, hence we contacted you. So if you can prove yourself to  be trusted and interested in this deal then we are prepared to do business  with you. What we want from you is the assurance that you will let us have  our share when this amount of US$41.5M is transferred into your  account. If this proposal satisfies you, please contact us, so we can advice  you on the modalities of the transaction. All modalities of this transfer,  have been worked out and once started will not take more than 7 Banking days  with the absolute support of all concerned. This transaction is 100% safe  and risk free now and after the transfer. Kindly treat this as urgent and  very confidential. Direct all reponses to jauba3206@yahoo.comRegards,Engr.
