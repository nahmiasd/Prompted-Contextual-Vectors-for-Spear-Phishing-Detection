Before the death of my father on FEBUARY 2004 in a private hospital here in Abidjan he secretly called me on his bed side and told me that he has a huge amount of fund deposited in a fixed deposit in one of the prime bank here in Abidjan, that he used my name as his only daughter for the next of kin in depositing of the fund. He further explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates.
