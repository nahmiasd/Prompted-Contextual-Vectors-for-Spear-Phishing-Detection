This contract was over-invoiced by us (myself and two junior colleagues) to the tune of (US$30.5 Million United State Dollars). Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested \nTelegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide.
