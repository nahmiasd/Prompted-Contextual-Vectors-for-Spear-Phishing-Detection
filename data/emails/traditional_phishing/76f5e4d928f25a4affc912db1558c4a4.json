In \n\naddition, we are members of the internal audit reveiw panel set up to \n\nreconcile all bonifide contract debts being owed to foreigners by the government of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nIn the course of our auditing, we came across the siad sum of $14m \n\nfloating in the ministry escrow account as an accrued debt payable to a yet \n\nun-identified contractor since 2001.On thorough examination,it was \n\ndiscovered that the $14M was a debt brilliantly created by the former \n\nDirector General in favour of a company that she was about to incorporate \n\nlocally here with the help of a foreign partner.\n\n\n\nWe made consultations with the former DG and eventually struck an \n\nagreement with her.The masterplan she created remains the same.The plan is \n\nto make you the chief beneficiary to the $14M by way of advancing \n\nyou/your company as the real contractor to whom the sum is owed by the \n\nMinistry for a project executed between 2000/2001.As a matter of  fact,all \n\nthe modalities needed to acheive this has already been perfected. The \n\noverall plan is 100% foolproof and will be carried out legally in every \n\naspect of the transaction. Specifically,your duty will be to act in \n\ncorrespondence (viaE-mails,Faxes & Telephone)- with the local Ministry of \n\nFinance as well as the Apex Bank authorities; until your total claims are \n\nverified,approved and the money paid into your advised bank account.\n\n\n\nWhereas we would like to maintain our full confidentiality for now, we  \n\nshall however provide you with more details as to the masterplan and \n\nthe entire time frames involved. We will do so when you indicate your \n\ninterest to become a partner with us.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to a cordial business partnership with you.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nEngr.Idris Lanre.\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nPlease reply to my private e-mail :engridrislanre_2005@fastermail.com\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nEngr.
