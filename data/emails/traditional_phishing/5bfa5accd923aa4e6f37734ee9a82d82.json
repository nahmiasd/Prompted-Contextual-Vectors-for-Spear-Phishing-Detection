I write to seek your operation as my Foreign partner and your assistance to enable me to invest in the stable economy of your country. I apologize if this mail does not suit your personal or business ethics. \n\n   I am Ojo Pedro , I am the Chairman of the Senate Financial Committee-on foreign contracts verification and payment. I am making this proposal to you in strict confidence. The money we want to invest was acquired as proceeds from over invoiced contracts to foreign companies. The amount in question is $25.500,000.00 Million US dollars. \n\n   As a senior civil servant in the Nigeria Government, our country's prudential policy forbids me to operate foreign account. If you will like to assist me as a partner, then indicate your interest after which we shall both discuss on the modalities. All other information to facilitate the remittance of the funds will be revealed to you in due course. \n   For your assistance, you shall receive 20% of the fund to be transferred and 10% will be set aside for all expenses incurred by both parties. I would like my proposal to be kept confidential because of what I explained above and you can reach me urgently by e-mail. \n\n  Please indicate your direct telephone and fax number when replying this business proposal. I will always call you when necessary, for now I will appreciate it if you can contact me through e-mail. \n\n  A swift acknowledgement on the receipt of this mail will be appreciated. Thank you and God bless you. \n\nBest regard, \nOjo Pedro\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site\n- http://yoursite.com\n\n\n", "id": "5bfa5accd923aa4e6f37734ee9a82d82"}
