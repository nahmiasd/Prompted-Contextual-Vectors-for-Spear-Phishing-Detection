I hereby ask for your help and assistance. Although I am a novice in business, I have an eye on rigid properties. Your advice on other areas of private sector will be highly appreciated.\nI believe that you would be of great help in guiding my son to a successful business investment in your country even when I am gone.\nI will appreciate if you will show interest in collaborating with us, as this transaction will benefit both of us on joint venture partnership. \nFurthermore I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage cash reward for your assistance.
