{"email_subject": "VERY URGENT!!!", "email_body": "Good Day, Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr. Bruno Lambert, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank, here in Mabella, Spain. One of our accounts, with holding balance of $15,000,000 (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) has been dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view this CNN website  for details on the crash. Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of either the account or the funds. I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after necessary processes have been followed. This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY contact me via this mail bruno100lambert@aim.com. Warm Regards, Mr. Bruno Lambert bruno100lambert@aim.com", "id": "9e5230d3ae2e051b3fb331f8c89d1c5e"}
