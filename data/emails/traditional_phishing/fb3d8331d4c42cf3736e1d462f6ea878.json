{"email_subject": "GREETINS FORM GRACE", "email_body": "My Dear,  I am MRS GRACE KOPI from Ivory Coast. I am a widow being that I lost my  husband a couple of months ago. My husband was a serving director of the  Cocoa exporting board until his death. He was assassinated on August 2003  by the rebels following the political uprising.  Before his death he deposited the sum of $14.5M fourteen Million five hundred  thousand USD in a private security Company in Europe which was for the importation  of cocoa processing machines. Note, according to my late husband the money  is in a trunk box and he did not disclose to the security company the real  content of the box he did it to reduce the cost of demurrage fees and for  the safety of the fund according to him, he declared to the security company  that the box contains a family valuables.  I want you to do me a favour, to help me invest this fund in a profitable  investment in your country as I do not have any knowledge of investment,  that will be after we retrieve it from the security company. For your efforts,  you shall either choose to receive 25% of the total fund or go into equal partnership  investment with me in your country. My interest is in areas, like real estate  and industrial production.  This is my reason for writing to you. Please if you are willing to  assist me and my only son Francoise, indicate your interest in  replying soonest. E-email : (grace_kopi@yahoo.com  )  Thanks and best regards .
