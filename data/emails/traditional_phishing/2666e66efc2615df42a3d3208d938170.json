{"email_subject": "Re-profiling", "email_body": "Good day, Hope you are doing very great? Getting your contact was not an easy task since my client ordered me to seek a partner very far away and I went to the institute of International Business to apply and I paid them the charges.  I Barrister Miroslav Vlado, representing Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky (M.k.) of Russia. He is one time the richest man in Russia and the head of YUKO'S OIL till that unfaithful day that they got him arrested and since then all his accounts and known businesses have been confiscated.  I would like to ask for your partnership in re-profiling funds over US$423 million. I will give the details, but in summary, the funds are coming via bank transfer. Please note that as an attorney I want a very straight forward and God fearing person, as this is a legitimate transaction and not a Childs play. You will be paid 10% for your \"management fees\".  You can log into this website to find out more about my client: <> if you are interested, please write back and I will provide further instructions. Keep this confidential as you could also reach me on \"mv_atexfirm@yahoo.co.uk\" Finally, please note that this must be concluded next week. I look forward to it.  Regards,  Miroslav Vlado.   (Barrister and Solicitors Esq.)", "id": "2666e66efc2615df42a3d3208d938170"}
