{"email_subject": "FAITHFUL COLLABORATION.", "email_body": "Dear sir/madam, How are you and your family today? Hope everyone is in good health. I am THEO MALOBU a citizen of Zimbabwe. I am contacting you from Cotonou, the Republic of Benin where I was given asylum this year. I am the only son of late politician KENNETH MALOBU who was a wealthy known farmer in Zimbabwe in partnership with late Martin Olds who was also murdered like my father in April 2000. I wouldn\u0092t go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this site if you have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have. <<<>>> Am appealing to you to consider the idea of assisting me in getting my fund left behind for me by my late father which was safely kept with a firm in Europe. My status will never in anyway permit me for carrying out this function being that i am in asylum. The contents of the consignments as cash was undeclared to the company but as family valuables. It is the sum of US$7,000.000.00 (SEVEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) cash. If this does interest you, we can go further for more details and negotiate terms. Please, let me know if you can assist me and kindly contact me via my Private mail box below so I can give you more details on how we shall proceed ( theomalobu@hotmail.ro ) As I wait for your urgent response, I advise you kindly keep this as top secret for now for my protection. Regards, THEO MALOBU theomalobu@hotmail.ro http://email.luxweb.com - votre adresse @email.lu gratuite", "id": "e29ea21498dd14ecff38cbf888195401"}
