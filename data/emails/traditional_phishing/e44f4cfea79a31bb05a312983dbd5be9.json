I am Eloy Sakiata Savimbi, son of the late General Jonas Savimbi; leader of Unita Rebel of Angola who died on the 22nd February 2002. Before the death of my father, he deposited the sum of US$15,000,000.00(fifteen million United States Dollars) in a private security trust company for safe keeping only. All the related documents are intact with me and I have currently contacted the company.
