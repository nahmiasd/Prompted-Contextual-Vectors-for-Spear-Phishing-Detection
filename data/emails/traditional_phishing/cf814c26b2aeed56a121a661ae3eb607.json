We later find out that the colonel and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was alsO discovered that Colonel Sadiq Uday did not declare any next of kin in his,official papersincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my \n bank. So, Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it, What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years and 6 month the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against thisbackdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Colonel Sadiq Uday so that you will be able to receive his funds.\n\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\n\n\n I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful.
