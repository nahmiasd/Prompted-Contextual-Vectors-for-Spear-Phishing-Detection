{"email_subject": "Mike Charles", "email_body": "  Attn,\n  Greeting, \nI solicit your confidence in this transaction that I propose to you. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. \nYour discreteness and ability to handle a transaction of this nature is of the uttermost importance. \n  Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.My name is  Mr Mike Charles Kobi, I'm the Son of late COL. JOHNSON KOBI (The assistant chief of general staff of sierra Leone\ufffds revolutionary united front R.U.F) and at the crown Prince of kuloma village in the south \ufffd west district of sierra Leone; who died on the 29th of august 2000 with some of his colleagues during the war in my Country.\n\n  I came to know of you in my \ufffdprivate\ufffd search on the Internet for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. In brief, I have the sum of Nine million, two hundred thousands US dollars (9,200,000:00 U.S. dollars). This money was deposited by my late father in a high secured security company here in Dakar - Senegal, of which I was made the sole beneficiary along side with my aged mother. \nBecause of the present situation in my country sierra Leone, I decided to leave the country immediately because of some security reasons and also to look for a trust worthy and reliable person(s) who can assist us to transfer this money out of Dakar Senegal based on the agreement that was signed by my late father and the security company before his death. \nAs a Young Man, I pray that you being a kind hearted person(s) will surely help me to transfer this money to your country and also to assist in investing it in a profitable business which will yield more money.  I feel that I can confide in you , hoping that you will not betray me. \n  I have proposed twenty per cent (30%) of this money to you, so as for you to give all necessary assistance and protections we need in your country, 60% for us and 10% for the expenses which both will incurred as a result of this transaction. \n  Please treat as highly confidential because our future depends  on this money being the only thing that we have after running away from our country. \n  All the vital documents covering this deposit in the security company are with me here in Dakar Senegal and will be faxed to you on demand after I certify that you are worthy to do business with. The reason I searched for you importantly is because, based on the agreement made by my late father and the security company that simply stipulates that in case of his death, his money should be transferred out of Africa. \n   I would like to secure my money in your care as I have decided to order a command to the security company to transfer the money to you depending on your urgent reply to my request and my assessment of your person. Note that this transaction demands the highest trust and confidence between the two of us. Moreover, it is risk free in the sense that I have taken proper care of all formalities regarding this transaction. \nIf this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me Mike Charles Kobi by writing to the above mail address.You can reach me with my aternative mail at(macdani500@hotmail.com) You will have to send your most confidential Telephone/Fax numbers so that I can relay confidential information - as they will come in directly to you. \nThanking you in advance for your anticipated cooperation. \nExpecting a reply. \nThank you.
