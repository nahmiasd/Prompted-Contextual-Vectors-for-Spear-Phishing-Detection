{"email_subject": "Greeting from Dubai.", "email_body": "Greetings from Dubai,\n \nThis letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.  I am Mr. Ali Raza Khan, currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank here in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\n \nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign  Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. jack farrer powell  made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my \nbank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003,as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. \n \nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter,but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr.jack farrer powell  died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. jack farrer powell  family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his \nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL.This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank \nmanagement is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.\n \nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support.  If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money.  \n \nI cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.  As the Account Officer to late jack farrer powell , coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug , I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that \nwill protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.\n \nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over the details.  \nThanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality . I shall send you copy of his last statement of account issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.  I wait your urgent response soon. \n  \n \nRegards,     \nMr. Ali Raza Khan.
