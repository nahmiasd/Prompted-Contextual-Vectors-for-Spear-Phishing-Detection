I lost my mother sometimes ago and after her death i came to meet my father for the very first time in Cote d' Ivoire, though he was also living in the state before he relocated back to Cote d' Ivoire to set up a business. \n\nExactely two months and one week after i came to meet my father with the help of US consulates he died, he was very sick when i came to meet him. Before their death in a private specialist hospital, my father called me on his bed side and secretly confided to me the sum of US$10 million dollars which he deposited in one of the banks in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire for onwardly transfer abroad for investment.\n\nThe reason i am telling you is that i am just a girl and there is little or nothing i could do on my own and again if my late father relative find out that my late father left that kind of money in my care i don't know what they might do to me, so i need you to help me contact the Bank as my late father foriegn business partner and claim the money for me as my friend and Guandian, and take me along with you.
