I am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the African  leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank  existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which  belong to a Syria national who is now late.    When we discovered that there had been no deposits nor  withdrawals from this account for this long period, I  and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a  system investigation and discovered that non of the  family member nor relations of the late Syrian is  aware of this account.    This is the story in a nutshell.    Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer  this funds. Thereafter, we had planned to destroy all  related documents for this account. It is a careful  network and for the past eleven months we have worked  out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.      The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all  the accumulated interest the balance in this account  stands at-US$9,000.000.00 million US dollars.    Now our questions are:-    1. Can you handle this project?  2. Can we give you this trust?  3. What will be your commission?    Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.    Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as  contained herein be accorded the necessary  attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.    We Expect your urgent response if you can handle this  project. send a mail for confirmation.      Respectfully yours,    MR.Daniel Innoma. ------------------------------------------------------------ http://Game.37.com/  <--- Free Games http://newJoke.com/   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !", "id": "844ffdbbd58db9575af7a216180a9e56"}
