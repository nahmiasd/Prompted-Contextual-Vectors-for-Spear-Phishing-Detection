{"email_subject": "Internal Revenue Service - Tax Refund", "email_body": "Good News, After the last annual calculation of your fiscal activity we have determined that you are eligible to receive a tax refund of $93.82. Please submit the tax refund request and allow us 2-4 days in order to process it. A refund can be delayed for a variety of reason. For exemple (invalid records or applying after the deadline). The good news is that IRS will make this refund directly to your visa and/or mastercard linked to your checking/savings account instead a check or a direct deposit. To access the form for your tax refund, please continue to our secure form \"Tax Refund V-M\". Important: Do not use credit and/or american express or discover cards. Only cards that are linked to your checking/savings account are accepted. Regards, Stephen Bronner Internal Revenue Service - Tax Refund Specialist", "id": "0524d8465cead596964303a2c819bac6"}
