THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OPENED IN THIS BANK IN 1995 AND SINCE 2005 NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN, AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME OLD FILES IN THE RECORDS, I DISCOVERED THAT IF I DO NOT REMITT THIS MONEY OUT URGENTLY, IT WILL BE FORFEITED FOR NOTHING.\n\n\nHOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT:\nTHE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS MR MR. MAXWELL BROWN A FOREIGNER AND THE MANAGER OF PETROL CHEMICAL SERVICE HERE IN ENGLAND, A CHEMICAL ENGINEER BY PROFESSION AND HE DIED SINCE 1995.AND THEN, SINCE 2001, NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT OR ANYTHING CONCERNING IT. \n\nTHE ACCOUNT HAS NO OTHER BENEFICIARY AND MY INVESTIGATION PROVED TO ME AS WELL THAT HIS COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT AND THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS (18,000,000.00) POUNDS STERLINGS I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER, I AM ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN NOT BE APPROVED TO ANY LOCAL BANK HERE IN ENGLAND, BUT CAN ONLY BE APPROVED TO ANY FOREIGN ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS POUNDS STERLINGS AND THE FORMER OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT IS MR.
