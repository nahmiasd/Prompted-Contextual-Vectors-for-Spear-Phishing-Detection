I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on\n25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard. \n\nThere is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death , I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.\n\nThe total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One hundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00\n[Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.\n\nI have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing\nhis/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.\n\nThe banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. \n\nIn view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the\ntransfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.\n\nUpon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer\ncan be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. \n\nWhen you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me or fax me VIA: \nTEL:870} 763 648313, {870} 763 648314,\nFAX:(870} 763 648315. You should also include\nyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.\nReply me through my alternative email box.{,jubeeg1@zwallet.com}\n\nRespectfully yours,\nJubeeg Venture.\nFreeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save \u00a37.50 a month \nwww.freeserve.com/anytime", "id": "958019073ac520b4b6cdecc5402486f6"}
