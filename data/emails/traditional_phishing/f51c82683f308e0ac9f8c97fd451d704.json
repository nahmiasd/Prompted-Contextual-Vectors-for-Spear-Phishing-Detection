After going through some old files\nin the records, I discovered that the owner of the\naccount  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is\nfloating and  if I do not remit this money out\nurgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner\nof this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a\nforeigner, and a sailor. He died since 1993\nand  no other person knows about this account or any\nthing concerning it. The account has no other\nbeneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well\nthat Phillip Morris until his death was the manager \nMorris Coy.(pty).

I am only contacting you as\na foreigner because this money cannot be approved to\na local person here without a valid international\nforeign passport, but can only be approved to any\nforeigner with valid international passport or drivers\nlicense and foreign a/c  because the money is in US\ndollars and the former owner of the  a/c, Mr. Phillip Morris was a foreigner too, [and the money can only\nbe approved into a foreign a/c].\n\nHowever, we will sign a binding agreement to bind us\ntogether.
