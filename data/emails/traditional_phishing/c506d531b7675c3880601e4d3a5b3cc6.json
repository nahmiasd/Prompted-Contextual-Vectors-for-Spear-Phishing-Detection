{"email_subject": "URGENT!!!", "email_body": "FROM: Sgt. Donald Greene\nTo whom it may concern.\nI am an American soldier, I am serving in the military of the 1st Armored Division in Iraq, as you know we are being attacked by insurgents everyday and car bombs.\nWe managed to move funds belonging to Saddam Hussein_s family. The total amount is US$7.2Million dollars in cash, mostly 100 dollar bills. We want to move this money to you, so that you may invest it for us and keep our share for banking.We will take 60%, my partner and I. You take the other 40%. No strings attached, just help us move it out of Iraq, Iraq is a war zone. We plan on using diplomatic courier and shipping the money out in one large silver box, using diplomatic immunity. If you are interested I will send you the full details, my job is to find a good partner that we can trust and that will assist us. Can I trust you? When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail signifying your interest including your most confidential telephone/fax numbers for quick communication also your contact details. This business is risk free. The box can be shipped out in 48hrs.\nRespectfully,\nSgt. Donald Greene\nPrivate Email: donald22greene@netscape.net\n\n", "id": "c506d531b7675c3880601e4d3a5b3cc6"}
