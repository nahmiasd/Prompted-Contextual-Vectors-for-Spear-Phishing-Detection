{"email_subject": "GREETINGS FROM CHINA.", "email_body": "\nDear friend,\n\nI am a staff of Private Banking Services at the Bank of China (BOC). I am\ncontacting you concerning our customer and, an investment placed under our\nbanks management 3 years ago.\n\nI would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail\nconfidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a\nresult of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation\nand no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you\nwith certain facts that I believe would be of interest to\nyou.\n\nIn 2002, the subject matter; ref: bb/boc/bank/0012 came to our bank to\nengage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over\n(invest) on his behalf.\n\nI was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in\nline with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the\nPrivate Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds\nhe wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any\ninvestments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth\nfunds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is\nto start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers\nand 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun\nthe money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our\nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this\npoint at over 10 million United States Dollars,\nthis margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk\nguaranteed returns on investments.\n\n In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed\nthat I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm. I informed\nhim that the bank would have to make special arrangements to have this\ndone and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to\nmake a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory\ncharges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I\nexplained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash\nmovement across borders has become especially strict since the incident\nof 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in and had the funds available.\n\n I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\ninstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security\nconsultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts\ndeposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that\nhandle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate\naccess to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar\nespecially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line\nwith instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he wanted the\nmoney there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week.\nThis was the last communication we had, this transpired around 9th\nOctober 2004.\n\nIn January this year, we got a call from the security firm informing us\nthat the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding\nposition as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the\nprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit , and\nI could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his\ndeposit. I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task\nof locating him to the internal investigations department of the bank of\nchina. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently he\nwas dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart\nattack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.\n\nThe bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving\nnext of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim\nhis estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who\npatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of\ndetachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to\nthem or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the\naccount and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private\nbanking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most\ncases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate.\n\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed\naway, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who\nshould have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past\nmonths been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. The investigation did not ever yield any result My official\ncapacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation\nand the only party to receive the results of the investigation.\n\n This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the\nend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to\nBOC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the\ndeposit back to BOC. This will result in the money entering the BOC\naccounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of\nthe Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have\nmy way.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nwho occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have\nbegun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and\nthey will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I\nalone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as BOC is\nconcerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I\nsent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to\nthe file are just customer services and due process.\n\nThey are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party\nthat comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great\namounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated\nfor months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.\n\nMy proposal;  I am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction\nfor the release of the  deposit to you as the closest surviving relation.\nUpon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in\nhalf. That is: I will simply nominate you as the\nnext of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the\nproceeds 50/50.\n\nI would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within\na few days. I will simply inform the bank of\nthe final closing of the file relating to the customer I will then\nofficially communicate with the  firm  and instruct them to release the\ndeposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would\nbe for us to have the firm direct the funds to another\nbank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to\nthink of receiving the money from the firm.  We can fine-tune this based\non our interactions.\n\nI am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no\ninterest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you\ndo not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you,\ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my\ncareer because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this\nbut people like myself who have made tidy sums out of\ncomparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a\ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be\nhard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that\nI make this move.\n\n Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let\nthis chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my\ndestiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my\nchance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with\nmy life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an\nopportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for\nthis project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated\nthe risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with\nme and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation,\ngood fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the\ncenter of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing.\n\nIf you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same\nemail account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this\nprocess towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact\nme via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project.\nI repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines\nnor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact\nme only through this email address. I do not want any direct link between\nyou and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are\nperiodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with\nour Total Quality Management Policy.\n\nPlease observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a\nfamily man; I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a\nmeasure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that\nnothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come\neasy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my\nprivate banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one\naccord, send me your response on this email fsh1953@yahoo.com.cn to enable\nus commences\nthis line of discussion.\n\nBest regards,\n\nShang Fulin\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d1606b4f9043ac3f016b0a16257381ad"}
