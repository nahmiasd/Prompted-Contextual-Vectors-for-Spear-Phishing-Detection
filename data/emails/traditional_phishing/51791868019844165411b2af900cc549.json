My investigation proved to me that the account \nhas no other beneficiary and that Mr. Franklin Sullivan until his death \nwas the manager Sullivan Coy.\n(pty). SA. We will start the first \ntransfer with Thirty six million dollars [$36,000,000.00] upon \nsuccessful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall \nre-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.\n\nThe \namount involved is (USD $136M) Thirty Six Million United States Dollars \nonly. I want to first transfer $36,000.000 [Thirty Six Million United \nStates Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad \nbefore the rest, but I don't know any foreigner.\n\nI am revealing this \nto you with believing God that you will never let me down in this \nbusiness. Also send your private telephone number and fax number \nincluding the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.
