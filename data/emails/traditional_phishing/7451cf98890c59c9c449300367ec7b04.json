{"email_subject": "reply pls", "email_body": "My Dear,\nIt is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below:May I first introduce my self: I am DR.(MRS.) MARIAM ABACHA,the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June\n1998. I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism,though,I did not disclose to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by the sponsor of the recommendation, I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).\n   This money was kept in a Security Company in Spain and I have \nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta,the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Switzerland,UK and Australia. In fact, the attack on ou!\n r family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband. My first son Mohammed Abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was just reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We are not ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts abroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.\n  In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival,our family trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas account, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in!\n  this regard with 25% of the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.In that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure (There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by you.)during the process of securing this fund.The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future. \n  My cousin (KADIRI MOHAMMED) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.\nAnd in due course, all contacts must be made through\nDR.KADIRI MOHAMMED through his Telephone: 00 221 5124859.\nE-mail address: kadiri_hammed@elvis.com\nI look forward to your quick response while thanking\nyou for your co-operation. In view of all above\ndetails, I request you to keep this letter and\nco-operation highly confidential.\nBest wishes,\nDR.(MRS). MARIAM ABACHA.\nABACHAS LODGE,KANO.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7451cf98890c59c9c449300367ec7b04"}
