Please pray that the good Lord forgive me my sins.I have asked God to forgive me and I believe he has because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation in less than one hour. I decided to WILL/donate the sum of $1,500,000 (One million five hundred thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and also to help the motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the widows. \u00a0At the moment ,I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the!   fact that my relatives are around me and my health status.I have adjusted my WILL and my lawyer is aware I have changed my WILL. You and he will arrange the transfer of the funds from my Uk Island Bank Account to your Bank.I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others. Contact my lawyer Barr.
