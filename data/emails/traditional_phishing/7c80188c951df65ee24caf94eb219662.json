{"email_subject": "From.Dr. John Idiris", "email_body": "Attn:\n My name is Master John Idiris, A complete citizen of Algerian living in Abidjan, a son to the late former minister of finance in  Algeria who was a victim of the terrorist attack against the country by the Abu sayyaf movement in the southern luxury beach region on the 11th April 2003 that rendered many people of different nationals dead. I inherited a total sum of 25 million dollars from my late father, This money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box was deposited with a security shipping  and finance company in Abidjan Cote d' ivoire under a secret arrangement as a family treasure. This means that the security company does not know the content of this box that was shipped from the Algeria to Cote d' ivoire under a diplomatic coverage. My main purpose of sending you this email is because of the way I found you and perhaps trustworthy to give this priority of shipping this box of money to any address that you think is very secure and safe in your country ! with your\n percentage of 15% when you receive the box and 5% for your expenses. There is need for urgent action because the consignment is accruing charges per day as demurrage to the security company for safekeeping couple with the resent attempt of coup plot last july that has distracted attention of the government and the security delegates on me. This is the contact of the company in Cote d' ivoire for you to call them and give them your address for the immediate shipment of the box today. I give thanks immensely for the co-operation as I look forward to your urgent response .\n Best Regard \nJohn Idiris\n\n \t\t\n---------------------------------\n Avez-vous essay\u00e9 le nouveau Yahoo!
