{"email_subject": "GREETINGS FROM REZA", "email_body": "\nDear Friend, \n \nAs you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is MR. REZA ABDULLA , a merchant in Safat, in (Kuwait) I was married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand American dollars (U.S.$10.700,000) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will\nwant you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set\naside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses. Reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address: mr4rezaabdulla@walla.com\n \n \nGod be with you.\nRegards,\nMR. REZA ABDULLA\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site\n- http://yoursite.com\n\n\n", "id": "2e34a6198563f5199057aa30f33e285e"}
