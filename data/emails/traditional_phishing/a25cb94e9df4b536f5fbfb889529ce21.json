A  sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the Company.  Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it overthe years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next  of kin for the past one year plus, I have removed the file to my  private volt.I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as  every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting  for a foreigner to enable me move the fund to his account.I will need  your private telephone   and fax numbers and your full name and address  of company or residential so that i can computerise them to tally with  the next of kin collum in the certificate of deposit.This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal  documentations will be handled by me.
