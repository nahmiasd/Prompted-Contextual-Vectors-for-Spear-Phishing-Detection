{"email_subject": "ATT: Proposal.", "email_body": "Greetings from Dave Yorke,\n\nI am Dr. Dave Yorke, Group Accountant (R.B.T.T) However, I have already sent you this same letter by post one month ago, but I am not sure if it did get to you since I have not heard from you, hence my resending it again.\n\nI discovered a dormant account in my office, as Group Accountant with Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. It will be in my interest to transfer this fund worth $28.5M Dollars (Twenty Eight Million Five hundred thousand Dollars)in an account offshore. Can you be my partner? Please get back to me ASAP if in the event you are interested.\n\nRegards and respect,\nDave Yorke.\n\n\n", "id": "5b92d297ad826fc71b689790fd1afe3f"}
