My father used his position then to make for himself and us the family some fortune. My father died after a protracted illness. I was studying overseas when my  father died and I was forced to return for the  funeral. His attorney notified me and my family about  my father's WILL with his chambers.   \nWhen I was going through the WILL, I discovered that my late father had used his  position  then to make some  money, which he brilliantly transferred and deposited with a private Security company here in Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa. \n \nHe deposited this consignment as valuables.The Security Company does not know that this consignment contains cash money, except the attorney and I. The amount is (Eighteen  million United States Dollars USD 18,000,000.00 MILLION). However, my aim of contacting you is for you to help me lodge the whole  sum into your nominated account in your country or any other part of the world. Secondly, you will also help me look for profitable investment overseas because I don't have knowledge of  international investments. \n \nAs a result of my present situation, I won't be able to conclude this transaction alone. If you are interested in helping me out, try and contact me with the above telephone number or my above  e-mail address indicating your interest to help me,not forgetting to include your private phone and fax numbers for easier communication. I will then\n furnish you with more details. \n  \nI have mutually agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum for your ssistance,   Then the remaining 75% will remain for my family and I, which you will help us invest.
