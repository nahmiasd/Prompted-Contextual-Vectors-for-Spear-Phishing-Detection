{"email_subject": "RE;  VERY  IMPORTANT", "email_body": "Dear Sir/Madam, This mail will definitely be coming to you as a surprise, but I must  crave your indulgence to introduce myself to you. I am Mr. John mensah Sulikuh, a supervisory manager at the United Trust Bank  Ltd,London. However I got your contact through the International web  directory.Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge Amount of Money  ValuedUSD17, 600,000.00 (Seventeen Million, six hundred Dollars Only) that  belongs to One of our late Customer MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS. who died In a  plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my Department came Across a very huge sum of money belonging to MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS from Beverwijk, Netherlands, who died along with his wife, MRS. KATRIEN DIONIJS and Daughter, MS. SOFIE DIONIJS so the fund has Been dormant in his account with this Bank without Any claim of the fund in our custody either from his Family or relation before Our discovery to this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for 15 years, it will be forfeited to the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed bill. It is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund.In order to avert this negative development. On behalf of my trusted colleagues we now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and  paid into your account as the beneficiary\ufffds next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased, MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS.  We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose. However, on smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% as gratification for your assistance to us, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses on both sides that may arise during the time of transfer and also for telephone bills, and the remaining 70% will be for me and my colleague. What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish. For confidentiality please contact me on my personal email account:sulikuh_john@rediffmail.com and sulikuh_john@ourwest.com  Best Regards, Mr. John Mensah Sulikuh United Trust Bank Ltd", "id": "7524323f71d3a26521e6f226adcbc95e"}
