Email;mr_mustaphasalleh@yahoo.com Dear,  I am Mr. Mustapha Salleh Manager National Bank of Dubai Abu Dhabi branch, I have urgent and very confidential business proposition foryou. A British Oil consultant and contractor with the Kruger Gold Company, Mr. Raymond Beck made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25m (Twenty Five Million United States American Dollars). in my branch.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck died in a plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Beck died in a plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990,1999 air crash (for more information about this crash and person you can contact this website Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25m (Twenty Five Million United States American Dollars).is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of United Arab Emirates, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paper work for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
