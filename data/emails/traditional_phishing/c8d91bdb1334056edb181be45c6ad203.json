Presently, there are some consignments deposited by various people for the past 6 years with nobody coming for them or paying for their demurrage. I carried out a private investigation and found out that most of them are dead and there are no traces of any member of their families.\nTo me this is an opportunity to make money because am a businessman who believe that only my family should come before my business. Hence I have decided to seek your assistance in this lucrative but profitable transaction. I need you to present yourself as the beneficiary of one late Mr. Abram abbas, a Jewish man who owns two of such consignments deposited with us. If you accept this offer, all the relevant documents will be prepared in your name with the assistance of some of my colleagues for the consignment to be transferred to your country of residence. After which I will come over to meet you so we can then share the valuables in these boxes and as well discuss business. The net worth of the contents inside each of these boxes is $12,000,000 (twelve million United States dollars).\nI will be willing to give to you 30% of the total sum upon the completion of the transaction if only you indicate your interest. I assure you that you will not be subjected to any form of illegality, as far as you work hand to hand with me on this.\nI hope to further strengthen my business relationship with you after the execution of this one.
