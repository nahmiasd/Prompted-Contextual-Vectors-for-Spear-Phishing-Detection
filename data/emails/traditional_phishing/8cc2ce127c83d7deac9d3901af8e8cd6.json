I got your email address from the web directory so I decided to contact you. We are interested in diverting some funds currently floating in the suspense account of the federal pay office to your account as soon as possible. \nSource of the funds: During the Arap Moi's government, governments officials awarded contracts to their own companies, these contracts were grossly overinvoiced. Now the present government set up contract review panel to settle those owed outstanding amount. My colleagues and I have identified a huge amount totaling US$ 870m (Eight hundred and seventy million us dollars) oversea . \nWe would wantUS$43.8m (Forty three million Eight Hundred Thousand) dollars out of this money overseas transferred to your account because we are not eligible to operate foreign accounts, and I have been mandated to search for a partner abroad. We really want this transfer made as soon as possible before the Government, who have started refunding money from Moi's foreign accounts track this money.We will be offering 20% for your assistance.\n If you would want to proceed with this transaction please reply with your name and phone number to jvayani@karibu.kenyaweb.com and if you do not accept my offer please treat with utmost confidentiality.\n\nBest Regards,\n \nDr. Jomo Vayani.\n\n\n", "id": "8cc2ce127c83d7deac9d3901af8e8cd6"}
